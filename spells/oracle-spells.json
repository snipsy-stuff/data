To absorb a rune, you must be aware of the rune’s existence (but need not know the details of what it actually does) and then succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the caster level of the spell affect being absorbed) as you touch the rune in question. If you fail this caster level check, the magical rune is not triggered unless you fail the roll by 5 or more.\n\nIf you succeed at the caster level check, the rune is removed from the surface it was originally placed upon and duplicated on the cloth of a silk glove worn on your hand. The rune remains located on the glove’s palm in an inert state for up to 1 minute per caster level. As a standard action taken at any time during that duration, you can transfer the rune to another surface similar to the one it was originally placed upon, at which point the rune’s function either returns to normal or dissipates harmlessly as if successfully dispelled (your choice). If the spell’s duration expires before you place the rune on a new surface, the absorbed rune dissipates harmlessly.\n\nAbsorb rune I affects only runes whose effects are equivalent to a spell of 3rd level or lower.

The caster can also create an eldritch monolith of his own design, whether conventional or wholly alien, often accounting for madmens’ tales of alien vistas and unearthly buildings that vanish without a trace when others try to substantiate their ravings. If a caster attempts to create a counterfeit of an existing building, a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) or Knowledge (history) check reveals the fabrication.\n\nAn eldritch monolith is solid and can be climbed (DC 20) or used to provide cover.

For example, a character casts accursed rot and touches a subject with iron body. A dispel check is made (DC 11 + the caster level of the spell immunity). If the dispel succeeds, the iron body is dispelled before the accursed rot takes effect. Accursed rot's dispelling can only affect spells cast upon a living creature.

You make a check for each instance of protection; a magic item so affected is suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds.\n\nNormally to remove the curse and cure the disease on another creature, a caster must touch the victim; this constitutes contact for purposes of spreading the disease so the caster of a remove curse or a remove disease would instantly become infected.

If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.

Using this spell can lower the target’s corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn’t at progression stage of 1 or higher.\n\nRemove Corruption: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of alleviate corruption doesn’t reduce the target’s corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.\n\nEither application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target’s manifestation level + 3 times the target’s corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).\n\nTampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting alleviate corruption on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it). A creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether it succeeds or not.",

The second diverts the course of the targeted river.\n\nAlter Current: The river's current increases or decreases in speed by up to 1 mile per hour per 2 caster levels you possess. A typical placid river travels at a rate of up to 2 mph (no effect on local movement); a swift river travels 2-4 mph, moving creatures and objects 10 to 40 feet downstream per round; and an area of river rapids travels 7-10 mph, moving creatures and objects 60 to 90 feet downstream per round. Altering the speed of the current alters the difficulty of swimming in the water accordingly.\n\nDivert River: The river diverts its course in a direction of your choosing. The river flows in the general direction indicated, but otherwise conforms to the shape of the local terrain. This spell cannot cause a river to flow uphill, though the river surges over its natural banks and inundates terrain lower than its average depth. Creatures in the path of the redirected river are in danger of being swept away; if directed properly, this spell causes a flood. See Aquatic Terrain on page 432 of the Core Rulebook for more details.\n\nAlter river can be made permanent with a permanency spell.  Clever application of spells such as move earth can be combined with this spell to likewise make the river's new course permanent.",

(poor). Fast movement affects their speed. \n- They retain all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature(s).

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.\n\nAn antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. \n\nSummoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) \n\nA normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. \n\nTwo or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. \n\nShould a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.",

    "description": "By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter. While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you). When this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes.",

    "description": "This spell removes the burden of misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.\n\nReverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost.\n\nRestore Class: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell.\n\nRestore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession.\n\nRedemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.\n\nNote: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.",

Furthermore, any ability damage caused by the poison does one additional point of damage each round and its duration is increased by 1 round. For example, if you had one dose of standard wyvern poison; injury; save DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; and it were augmented by a 11th level wizard with a Intelligence score of 22, it would become augmented wyvern poison injury; save DC 21; frequency 1/round for 7 rounds; effect 1d4+1 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; \n\nIf the duration of the spell expires, the augmented effect ends immediately. Thus, if a person has suffered 6 rounds of the augmented wyvern poison and the spell ends before the 7th round it would not deal damage on the seventh round.\n\nThis spell only affects discrete doses of poison, though they may already be placed on a weapon, trap, or other item. Thus, if the spell were cast on a 10-gallon vat of wyvern poison, it would have no effect.

    "description": "Bestow affliction causes the target to suffer a permanent physical or mental disability. This curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with the use of break enchantment, remove curse, limited wish, wish, or miracle.\n\nThe caster can choose an affliction to bestow from the following list:\n\nBabble: The afflicted's ability to speak coherently is compromised. Any time he attempts to communicate (including casting spells with verbal components), he must make a Will save (DC 16) or whatever he says comes out as gibberish.\n\nBarrenness/Infertility: Certain demons, curses and diseases (and of course, old age) caused people to be unable to produce or bear offspring. This is a touchy subject, and the effects of the affliction might be entirely unimportant in some campaigns. It can be cured by any of the spells listed above, or by a fertile womb spell.\n\nCataracts: Cataracts are an affliction that permanently degrades one's eyesight (-2 to Search and Spot checks, -4 to attack rolls, and any Dexterity bonus to AC is halved). It can be cured by the spells listed above, or by a combination of the remove disease and cure blindness spells.\n\nDementia: The afflicted's ability to interact with the real world is compromised. Any time he attempts to take a decisive action, he must make a Wisdom check (DC 13), or act as though under the influence of a confusion spell.\n\nDiseased: The afflicted has suffered physical scars from numerous sicknesses, and he perpetually stinks of infection. He suffers a -5 penalty to his Charisma score.\n\nEcstatic: The afflicted's ability to understand danger is compromised. In any excited or dangerous situations, he must make a Wisdom check (DC 13), or spend the next 1d4 rounds singing and dancing like a drunk. While in ecstasy he is unable to attack or to use any active defenses. At the end of the madness, make another Wisdom check or the ecstasy continues.\n\nFixation: The afflicted takes on a quest in search of an unattainable goal (e.g. an imaginary object or impossible ideal) that puts him (and allies) into dangerous situations.\n\nForgetfulness: The afflicted's ability to remember facts is compromised. Any time he must do something that requires accessing his memory (including casting memorized spells), he must make an Intelligence check (DC 13).\n\nImpotence: The afflicted's ability to participate in sex and to procreate are compromised. This is another touchy subject, and its effects might be entirely unimportant in some campaigns.\n\nLameness: The afflicted's speed is halved, and he becomes incapable of running or charging. He also suffers a -10 penalty to Acrobatics and Swim skills.\n\nMute: The afflicted loses the power of speech. He can still make himself understood through writing, and his hearing is unaffected.\n\nParanoia: The afflicted's ability to separate friend from foe is compromised. Any time someone confronts him with an unexpected situation, he automatically views the other as an enemy and must make a Wisdom check (DC 10) to avoid attacking him.\n\nPhobia: The afflicted develops an irrational fear of a common object, creature, or condition. He believes the object of the phobia poses an immediate threat to him and may even see it where it doesn't exist.\n\nSickly: The Sickly affliction means that the victim is more likely to contract diseases. A Sickly person always has a low-level cough or fever, and a -4 penalty to saves against disease.",

A remove curse spell only grants a second saving throw, if this second save is failed, additional remove curse spells have no effect.\n\n• Drought: If the accursed tries to raise crops, they shrivel and die.\n\n• False Justice: The accursed is repeatedly accused of crimes he didn't commit. Furthermore, he is utterly unconvincing when defending himself against these charges, suffering a -4 penalty to all Charisma and Charisma-based skill checks when attempting to talk his way out of trouble.\n\n• Flame Prone: Any time there's fire within 30 ft. of the accursed, he must make a Reflex save (same DC as this spell), or a spark flies into his lap and sets him on fire, doing 1d4 damage that round and igniting his clothing unless he makes a second Reflex save.\n\n• Homeless: Neither spell nor effort of foot nor force of will suffices to allow the accursed to return to his home. Any attempt to teleport there fails; any journey is misled so the accursed stays away.\n\n• House of Fire: Every time the accursed sleeps under the roof of a friend or relative or of a home of his own, he must make a Will save (same DC as this spell) or the dwelling is consumed by fire.\n\n• Into an Enemy's Hands: That thing which is most precious to the accursed (a spouse, a jewel, a weapon, an honor, a title) falls into the hands of a hated enemy.\n\n• Loss of Limb: One of the accursed's limbs withers and becomes useless.\n\n• Nameless: No one remembers the accursed's name, except to curse it or associate it with evil deeds. No good deed committed by the accursed is remembered.\n\n• Plague Carrier: Anyone who spends more than one hour a day in the company of the accursed must make a Fortitude save (same DC as this spell) or contract a random disease (see contagion spell); this check must be made daily. The accursed himself doesn't contract any disease as a result of this curse.\n\n• Stench of the Dead: The accursed smells like a festering corpse. His Charisma suffers an effective -5 penalty.\n\n• Tongue of the Liar: The accursed is unable to tell the truth, even to save his life. His lies are almost always interpreted in ways that get him in trouble.\n\n• The Water Shall Devour Him: Every time the accursed passes near a body of water or boards a ship, something happens to throw him into the water.\n\n• Unexpected Enemy: A previously unknown family member of the accursed (typically a son or a half-brother) wants him dead.",

The touched creature gains that plane’s basic infusion for the spell’s duration. This spell has no effect if cast on the Material Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell’s target leaves the plane with which it has been infused. Details on planar infusions can be found in each plane’s Infusion section, as presented in Chapter 3 of this book.\n\nOnce a creature gains the benefits of bestow planar infusion I, it remains attuned to that plane for 24 hours. Additional castings of bestow planar infusion I during this time bestow the same infusion that was granted by the initial casting that day. Planar infusions that can be used a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by multiple castings of bestow planar infusion I.",

A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Perception checks suffer a -8 penalty. Ranged weapons, other than siege weapons, are impossible to operate; siege weapons suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. Movement through the area is considered difficult terrain even for flying creatures; each square counts as 2 squares of movement.\n\nThe swirling sands and debris deal 8d6 bludgeoning damage +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knock them prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the bludgeoning damage and negates being knocked prone. Flying creatures are forced to the ground by the powerful downdraft and take damage as if they fell unless they make a successful Fly check (DC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier), in which case they remain a ttheir original altitude.\n\nCreatures that are knocked prone are buried beneath the sand. Buried creatures are protected from the swirling sands above but take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from the sand's weight per minute spent under the sand. If rendered unconscious, the victim must make a Constitution check (DC 15 + 1 per previous check) each minute or suffer 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. In addition to the aforementioned physical damage, a buried creature also lacks breathable air and immediately starts suffocating. A buried creature can free itself by making a DC 15 Strength check. The DC increases by +2 for each previous failed check. Creatures that aren't buried can dig out their friends in 1 round; however, precisely locating a buried creature requires a DC 25 Perception check.",

In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw, with a +2 bonus, to avoid falling into it. At any point during the duration of the spell other targets may be forced into this pit by means such as a bull rush.

    "description": "In order to prepare this spell, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you cut yourself and swear an oath of retribution on your own blood. You decide how much damage you want to take from this attack, up to 25 points. This damage cannot be healed for as long as the spell is in effect. Anytime you perform an attack, save, or check that is directly related to the oath and brings you closer to the fulfillment of that oath, you gain a morale bonus to that roll equal to the number of hit points of damage you took from the oath divided by 5. The GM is the final arbiter over whether or not an action qualifies for this bonus. When you fulfill the oath (or choose to forsake it), the spell ends, and the lost hit points can be healed as normal.\n\nFor example, a notorious bandit leader killed Stigur’s brother, and Stigur wants to avenge his brother’s death. Stigur casts this spell and sacrifices 20 hit points. Thereafter Stigur gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls against the bandit leader’s minions, saves against spells from said minions, Intimidate checks to coerce an informant to tell him where the bandit leader is camped, and so on.",

The food appears on ornate serving trays or in exquisite covered tureens, as appropriate to each type of dish. Place settings and serving utensils also appear - enough for each creature that will participate in the feast - along with elegant tablecloths and table linens. The spell doesn't create furniture, but the feast does adapt to appear on top of existing tables (or similar objects in the environment).\n\nThough the feast and all the finery last only 1 hour, creatures that partake remain nourished and sated for 24 hours. Though you have little control over the fine details of the feast, you can specify what type of dish you want for each course and what sorts of beverages are provided. The feast automatically adjusts depending on the type of spellcaster you are. For instance, a druid casting this spell typically creates a spread of natural berries, whole roasted animals, and sweet (and possibly fermented) nectar for beverages, all on rough-hewn wooden plates with chopsticks instead of silverware and sizable leaves replacing napkins.",

The bearer gains the benefits of protection from evil and sanctuary, but only against that mummy.\n\nUnsealing or breaking a jar is a standard action, which dissipates its power (and protection) but lets the bearer issue a short command to the mummy, similar to a suggestion spell (Will DC 23 negates). You (and only you) may unseal all 4 jars in a 10-minute ritual to control the mummy with an effect similar to geas (Will DC 23 negates); most casters typically include a restriction that the mummy will not harm them, as unsealing the jars leaves them vulnerable.",

Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell.\n\nIf you are using the downtime system from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature’s highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so.\n\nFuneral: A funeral service must involve a corpse and at least one willing companion or next of kin. The subject gains a +2 sacred bonus against death effects.\nHoliday Fete: A holiday fete may involve up to two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves.\nMarriage: A marriage must involve two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on saves against fear and emotion effects.\nNaming: A naming must involve a willing parent or parents and a newborn (who is touched but unaffected). The subject can use sanctuary once.\n\nThe augmented versions of these four ceremonies are identical, granting the subject a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws.\n\nIn addition to these four ceremonies, each cleric gains two more ceremonies according to her domain. For information on domain ceremonies and their relevant boons, see Quests and Campaigns pg 24-25.",

If no creature accepts the weapon, the subject drops the weapon on the ground.\n\n3rd Priority: Cast beneficial spells and/or use beneficial magic items (including potions, wands, and so on) on creatures within 30 feet, starting with the closest creatures.\n\n4th Priority: The subject gives away his non-worn possessions - the contents of a backpack or similar item count as one item each, as does the container itself - to creatures within 30 feet. If no creature accepts the items, the subject drops the items on the ground.\n\n5th Priority: The subject gives away his remaining possessions (including his armor, boots, cloak, and so on) to creatures within 30 feet.

You take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain when you begin the speech and can’t reduce or prevent this damage in any way. Each intelligent creature in the spell’s area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell’s duration. Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a -4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can’t force beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.\n\nIf your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), your sanity score decreases by 2 (and thus your sanity edge decreases by 1) instead of taking Wisdom drain each time you cast this spell. Only greater restoration, miracle, or wish can remove this decrease. A single casting of greater restoration removes one decrease in sanity from casting compelling rant, while a casting of miracle or wish removes them all. Affected targets take sanity damage equal to half your caster level (maximum 10) instead of Wisdom damage. The targets might actually change alignment and beliefs if their loss of sanity afflicts them with an appropriate madness, in which case those effects last even after the spell’s duration has ended.",

Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers minor disruption, suffering a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus to positive channeled energy DCs, -2 penalties for undead in the area). You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron.

    "description": "You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures, starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can’t contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can’t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don’t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn’t call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.\n\nHow creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn’s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like scrying, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.\n\nEach type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table.",

The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas.\n\nLower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.\n\nRaise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land. With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect.",

    "description": "This spell functions as create lesser demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with create lesser demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\n\nAlignment: Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, GameMastery Guide 187). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.\n\nBountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.\n\nElemental: Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water- elemental dominant trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, GameMastery Guide 186).\n\nGravity: By default a demiplane's gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane's gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional (see Gravity, GameMastery Guide 184).\n\nSeasonal: The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on).\n\nShape: By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size, GameMastery Guide 185). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.\n\nStructure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).\n\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp. If you have cast create demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own permanency spell.",

A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits.\n\nMagic: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait (see Magic Traits, GameMastery Guide 187). If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \"effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\" or \"death spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.\" A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.\n\nMorphic: You may use move earth at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell's normal casting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal.\n\nPortal: Your demiplane gains a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it).\n\nTime: By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane.

    "description": "You create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \"walls\" and \"ceiling\" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\n\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade.\n\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection, etherealness, or plane shift. You are considered \"very familiar\" with your entire demiplane.\n\nAs a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish, mage's disjunction, miracle, or wish and making a successful dispel check.\n\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.\n\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own permanency spell.",

A creature that takes a dose of one of these drug typically must be either willing or helpless, though some drugs might be inhaled, applied to injuries, or secretly slipped into food if the caster acts swiftly (see each drug’s description). The DC to resist a drug created by this spell is based on the conjurer’s caster level, not the DC listed in the common versions of the drug. For more information, see Drugs and Addiction on page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.\n\nAs a special use of this spell, a lawful evil worshiper of Mahathallah, the Dowager of Illusions, can create doses of the drug adyton (see the sidebar above). A Mahathallah worshiper can create adyton only once per week, regardless of her level or how many times she casts this spell. The spell otherwise functions—and creates as many doses—as normal.",

Each day, one ability at random is affected. Roll 1d6 to determine which ability is changed. For that particular day, the ability gains a -4 inherent penalty (to a minimum of 1).\n\n1d6   Ability\n1       Strength \n2       Dexterity \n3       Constitution \n4       Intelligence \n5       Wisdom \n6       Charisma\n\nAnnoying: The second mode of the fluctuating curse is intended to simply frustrate or teach a lesson to the cursed individual, but it can be used in conjunction with the baneful mode of the curse to make the subject's life miserable. Roll for 1d4 physical traits of the cursed creature that change for that day, and then roll to determine how each trait changes.\n\n1d12    Physical Change 1           Height 2           Weight 3           Hair color 4           Eye color 5           Skin color 6           Body hair 7           Vocal pitch 8           Apparent age 9           Facial appearance 10         Skin texture 11         Odor 12         Size or shape of randomly chosen body part\n\n2d4      Amount of Change 2          Changes drastically to that of a different race, sex, or species 3          Major detrimental change 4          Minor detrimental change 5          Constant miniscule changes 6          Minor positive change 7          Major positive change 8          Cursed individual chooses how he changes\n\nThe GM is left to adjudicate exact changes. Changes that are detrimental or positive might grant a circumstance bonus (+/-1 for minor, +/-3 for major) to appropriate skill checks. For example, a majorly detrimental change in weight could make the cursed individual so obese to grant a -3 circumstance penalty to all Dexterity-based checks, or a minor positive change in body hair might grant a +1 circumstance bonus to social skills like Bluff or Diplomacy because of how well-groomed the character looks. This spell is not fatal, does not cause damage, and every day the changed attributes revert to normal, and different ones change. All changes of appearance are merely cosmetic. Fish heads do not let the target breathe water, but nor does the target suffocate in air. A curse of chaos can be removed as a normal bestow curse, and can also be affected by dispel magic.",

The spell is still dismissable if made permanent.\nSpell - Minimum Caster Level - GP Cost\nLesser curse terrain - 9th - 2,500 gp\nCurse terrain - 11th - 7,500 gp\nGreater curse terrain - 15th - 17,500 gp\nSupreme curse terrain - 19th - 27,500 gp",

Each time the bell rings, all living creatures within the area of effect are struck by an audible wave of necromantic energies. The magic creates only one such wave per round; additional ringing attempts cause only normal chiming. On the first round, this sonic attack causes damage equal to one-half the death tolling caster's level in hit points, rounded down (a 17th-level wizard would inflict 8 points of damage). Every successive time the bell is rung, the amount of damage dealt by the wave is reduced by 1 point.\n\nOnce the damage reaches zero, the spell ends (the bell can ring normally, but it won't deal damage until death tolling is cast on it again). The damage occurs in a 50-foot-radius spread/caster level (so the wave produced by a 15th-level sorcerer would have a maximum range of 750 feet). Aside from the bellringer and creatures incapable of hearing (including permanently or temporarily deafened individuals), all living creatures in earshot are affected unless underwater or protected by a building, cave, or some other natural phenomenon (such as the roar of a waterfall) that prevents them from properly hearing the toll of the bell (GM's discretion). Only living creatures able to hear as humans do are affected bythis spell; constructs, oozes, plants, and undead of all types are immune.\n\nEvery creature within the area of effect may attempt a Will save to avoid damage. Any successful Will save results in half damage but also prevents a creature from suffering additional damage from that particular death tolling casting (no matter how often thereafter that creature hears the bell's sonic attack). A caster can only have one death tolling spell in effect at a time, a second casting discharges the previous spell.",

For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks deathwine made from a potion of cure serious wounds would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster.\n\nIn addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) benefits from a potion affected by deathwine as per the potion’s normal effects. Any healing potion not imbibed before this spell’s duration expires is destroyed.",

You can resize the sphere as an immediate action every round, up to its maximum size. Those within the sphere are impervious to all ranged attacks, whether physical (arrows, javelins, and falling boulders) or magical (spells, spell-like abilities, and super natural abilities). Likewise, such attacks cannot be launched from within the confines of the sphere at targets outside its area. No creature can pass through the barrier, either way, without your conscious consent (although it is a free action for you to allow it), so melee attacks through the sphere are impossible as well. (Creatures with your mental permission can move through the sphere and make melee attacks, but then they are outside its confines.) Creatures cannot pass through the sphere more than once per casting of the spell, even with your permission. You can never make attacks through the sphere or move outside it without ending the spell. Environmental threats, from poison gas to horrible cold or a raging fire, do not affect those within the area of the sphere - the interior is always safe and comfortable.\n\nIf you change the size of the sphere, you do not \"drag\" creatures or objects. If your reshaping the sphere would cause something to no longer be within its confines, the sphere passes through it harmlessly. Thus, the sphere can pass through the ground, walls, or stationary objects without problem and its size is not subject to the limits of line of effect. Even magical movement - such as teleportation, ethereal travel, or creatures moving incorporeally - does not allow passage through the sphere if you do not wish it. Likewise, conjured creatures, objects, or energies cannot appear within the area of the shell without your consent if the conjurer is outside it.",

The creature moves toward you at its best speed, moving to avoid obvious dangers en route to you. Once within reach, the target gives you whatever it holds in its hands (or wears on its hands or wrists) owns, and as an immediate action you can take possession of the item as long as you have a free hand. If you do not take the item by the end of your next turn, the compulsion ends. The target is not prevented from defending itself if attacked. The spell has no effect if the target has no means of moving toward you to deliver its gift, including if it is restrained from moving or faced with an impassable or obviously dangerous barrier, such as a wall of fire.",

    "description": "You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\n2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\n3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura eminates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\n\nMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\n\nAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\n\nLingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:\n\nOriginal Strength - Duration of Lingering Aura\nFaint - 1d6 rounds\nModerate - 1d6 minutes\nStrong - 1d6 x 10 minutes\nOverwhelming - 1d6 days\n\nOutsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area.

You can detect a lingering aura for up to 1 day per caster level you have, regardless of the aura's original strength.\n\nAdditionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell's area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster's aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 + the creature's caster level.\n\nFinally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it. In order to find these identifiers in a spell's aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge {arcana} check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them). Once you learn a caster's set of identifiers, you can remember them as easily as a face or a voice. You can recognize this signature if you succeed at a Spellcraft check when later identifying a spell to determine whether or not that spell was cast by the same individual. The spell greater magic aura (see page 219) can obfuscate this information, making it seem that someone else cast the spell. Greater detect magic grants a saving throw against magic aura (but not greater magic aura).",

    "description": "You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.\n\nTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\n\nCounterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.",

The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.\n\nArea Dispel: When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst.

For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\n\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\n\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\n\nCounterspell: This functions as dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.",

The holy knight used the combined might of the agathion's great strength and his own to win the day for the crusaders. Now, although the spell is still in use chiefly among those that patrol the borders of the Worldwound, other champions of good have carried it with them to all corners of the Inner Sea region.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you reach into the great beyond and beseech a good-aligned outsider for their aid against evil. The outsider infuses a small portion of its own power into you, making you a powerful force for good. You gain a +2 morale bonus on all Perception checks made against evil creatures, a +2 bonus on Initiative checks, and detect evil as a constant spell-like ability.\n\nIn addition, once during the spell's duration you can call forth a surge of holy power when fighting an evil creature. Doing so is a swift action that shortens the spell's remaining duration so that its remaining hours of duration become rounds of duration. For the rest of this duration, the surge of power grants you the following benefits: \n\n• A +2 sacred bonus to AC \n• A +4 sacred bonus to Strength \n• Resistance 5 to acid and fire \n• A +5 sacred bonus on all Intimidate checks made against evil creatures \n• Fast healing 2 \n• Any critical threat roll made against an evil creature with a weapon you wield is automatically confirmed.\n\nAlthough this surge of power can be activated against any evil opponent, this ability activates automatically as soon as you attack any evil outsider, regardless of whether you hit or not, and regardless of whether you actually recognize that the target is in fact an evil outsider. In such cases the activation is a free action.\n\nNongood spellcasters can cast this spell, but doing so causes them to be sickened (for spellcasters who are neither good nor evil) or staggered (for spellcasters who are evil) for the spell's duration.",

    "description": "When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.\n\nCave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.\n\nCliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\n\nOpen Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Chapter 13 for more details).\n\nStructure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\n\nRiver, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.\n\nPinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.",

This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it. \n\nYou may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness.

Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action. \n\nWhen you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance. Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image. \n\nYou may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed.

Since the torrent passes through barriers, it can weaken entire areas, not just the surface of objects. This has the general effect of weakening metal enough that it can be broken like sturdy wood, weakening stone or crystal enough that it can be dug through like dirt, or completely reducing weaker structures to dust. Objects weakened in this way do not change in composition, only sturdiness. Decayed gold becomes gold dust, and ice merely turns to snow. A successful save results in half damage. Attended objects are unaffected if their bearer succeeds on his save, but are weakened as normal if the bearer fails his save.

    "description": "Excommunicate allows a cleric to cast a member of her faith out of her church and the sight of her god. You can only cast this spell if you are an official representative of the church and you cannot use it on a person who holds a higher rank within the church than you do. When you cast a ban, you must state the crime that your target has committed against your church; this message is limited to 100 words and will be relayed to the target by a whispering wind along with the name of caster. Under normal circumstances no saving throw is allowed. However, if the target is a member of your church and is innocent of the crime that you've accused her of, she may negate the spell with a successful Will save. \n\nExcommunicate prevents a target from casting atonement and excommunicate. However, when you cast it on a member of your faith the effects are far more severe. If the victim is a divine spellcaster, she loses the ability to receive spells or channel energy. A paladin also loses all her mercy abilities, but keeps her other class abilities. Regardless of her class, the victim cannot benefit from divine spells of her (former) faith - although she can still suffer the effects of hostile magic. If a cleric of her faith attempts to cast a beneficial spell on her, he will sense her status; the spell is lost, but the cleric knows why it failed. \n\nThere are no visible signs of excommunication. Under normal circumstances, it can only be discovered by trying to cast a beneficial spell on the target. If the victim is revealed as an excommunicate, the attitudes of any NPCs who share the faith will be reduced by at least one category. In some religions the faithful are not allowed to interact with those who have been excommunicated; if this is the case, the victim will probably be exiled as part of her sentence. \n\nAny higher-ranking priest from your church can remove your ban, if she herself is not under the effects of a curse such as excommunicate; she simply makes a formal statement absolving your victim of her crime. Alternately, a lower-level priest of your religion may help your victim by casting atonement on her behalf - although if the victim did commit the crime of which you accused her, she must honestly repent her actions. Otherwise, the only way to remove the ban is through a miracle or wish. Note that \"higher-ranking\" does not necessarily mean \"of higher level.\"",

Similarly if a creature or object is threatened by a horde of trolls, you would also see the trolls. If you cast the spell on an area, you can be anywhere within the affected area when you cast the spell. If you cast the spell on a creature or object, you must touch the target during casting. Although it is fairly simple to adjudicate when a trespasser has violated a particular area, a threat to a particular creature or object is more difficult to define. In broad terms, whenever the spell's target is within the line of sight of any creature, entity or being intent on doing it imminent harm, it is being threatened. You receive the mental images for as long as the threat or transgression lasts. The act of receiving and interpreting these mental images requires concentration. If you cease concentrating and focus your attention elsewhere, the transmission of the images stops until you resume concentrating on the spell. The spell also ends if the trespasser leaves the warded area, the threat to the creature or object has been eliminated or the creature or object has been killed or destroyed. You can only protect one area, creature or object at any given time. If detected, the protected area, object or creature radiates a strong aura of abjuration magic.",

Fire charm requires no further action by you after casting to continue fascinating the creatures involved, and you can leave the area of effect without disrupting their attention upon the fire. However, the reactions of enraptured creatures toward you functions as normal for enthrall if you do communicate with them. In addition, the rippling patterns of the fire charm distract and unravel the willpower of entranced creatures, causing them to take a -4 penalty to Will saves and Wisdom checks (including Wisdom-based skill checks).\n\nIf the fire source is extinguished, the spell ends but creatures spend 1d3 rounds recovering from their trance (as enthrall). If the fire is not extinguished but their line of sight to it is interrupted, affected creatures will spend 1d3 rounds moving to find a better view of the fire charm. If after this time they still have no line of sight to the fire, their trance ends.\n\nIf the target fire source is Small or smaller, it can entrance creatures within 20 feet. For every size category of the target fire larger than Small, this range is increased by 20 feet, up to 120 feet for a Colossal fire.\n\nA fire charm can entrance vermin even though it is a mind-affecting effect.",

As noted in animate dead, you can’t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.\n\nThis spell disguises the zombie’s appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie’s outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie’s normal staggered condition doesn’t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the flesh puppet as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.\n\nAn ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can’t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.\n\nThe string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won’t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.\n\nWhen this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse.

This spell also requires a relatively flat, smooth surface and your own spittle or blood.\n\nTo cast this spell, you must smear the spittle or blood across the required surface and place all the items to be transformed there. The spell's magic then turns all of the items into the semblance of gold coins. They all look alike (that is, of the same minting), are all of the same size, and ring, weigh, and handle like gold coins (if they were glass shards, they won't have cutting edges that drawn blood).\n\nYou can make the transformed \"coins\" bear any fanciful image and wording you can think of, and you can choose how worn or new they look. If bitten, peered at, treated with acid droplets as an alchemical assayer would, and examined closely, they seem genuine; for all intents and purposes, they are gold coins. However, if such a coin is melted, cut, or crushed, it will revert to its true material (and in damaged condition; melted, cut, or crushed). When the spell expires, fools gold coins revert to their former state.\n\nA cleric or paladin of your own faith knows at a glance that a gold coin you have created with this spell isn't real, but others (even those familiar with this spell) won't, unless they use magical means to reveal the deception (such as detect magic or true sight).",

    "description": "Over the course of the one-hour casting time, the subject is indoctrinated in the beliefs of your deity and/or ethos. Forbidden conversion can achieve two different objectives, or both of them. When both are attempted, the subject makes two saving throws, one for each effect. This spell does not force the subject to listen. The caster must arrange that with a successful Bluff, Diplomacy or Intimidate check against the subject's Sense Motive check or he may employ force by incapacitating the subject in some manner that leaves the subject conscious: tying him up, paralyzing him, etc. The two different objectives of forbidden conversion are explained below.\n\n• Alignment Shift: Cast in this way, on a failed saving throw, the subject's alignment shifts one degree toward that of your deity's alignment. The subject's alignment will shift the farthest alignment component first. A cleric of a chaotic neutral deity casting this spell on a lawful good subject would cause his alignment to shift to neutral good. When both alignment axes are equally different, the cleric can choose which axis to affect. A cleric of a chaotic evil deity casting this spell on a neutral subject chooses whether the subject becomes neutral evil or chaotic neutral if the subject fails the saving throw.\n\n• Conversion: Cast in this way, the subject is forcibly converted to the worship of the caster's deity. Devout followers of another deity (clerics, paladins, etc.) get a +4 bonus to their saving throw against this version of the spell. If the subject's alignment is not compatible with the beliefs of the deity, this conversion will eventually fade over time.\n\nNothing short of a limited wish, miracle, wish or another casting of forbidden conversion can reverse the effects of this spell.\n\nNote: Many deities will refuse to grant their clerics access to this spell or to one of the versions of the spell. The use of limited wish, miracle, wish or this spell to reverse a prior casting of this spell may not require the XP cost if the deity granting the spell would normally not allow that form of this spell to be cast.",

    "description": "Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate.\n\nThe gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.\n\nPlanar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you - anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\n\nCalling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures. If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in \"livestock\" rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.\n\nNote: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.",

    "description": "Casting this spell constitutes performing a rite of sacrifice to the archdevil Mammon, making an offering to the Lord of Erebus and channeling a measure of his disembodied might into a single coin. The power and abilities of this vestige correspond directly to the value of the offering, allowing for three distinct e!ects.\n\nCorrupted Coin: Making a sacrifice worth 1,500 gp corrupts the focus into a \"lucky\" or \"unlucky\" coin as per the caster's will for 1 month. Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on all Appraise, Bluff, Craft, and Profession checks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an e!ect similar to the spell augury once per day - its flip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if di!erent from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as a free action, influence the result as he chooses.\n\nMammon's Mantle: Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin. Upon ingesting the coin, the target gains a bonus to Charisma equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bearer's blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging e!ects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no benefit). The coin's e!ects last for 1 day per caster level.\n\nGold Guardian: Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard (see previous page) forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. After this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creature's hit points by 1 per day. When the guardian's hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed. Coins lost from the guardian can be replaced, restoring any lost hit points.\n\nIn addition to the e!ects of any of these offerings, should the focus coin be swallowed, any being sired or conceived by the creature while the magic is in e!ect is born as a tiefling (bearing an indirect relation to Mammon himself).",

The stones can be enhanced with spells as though they were projectiles. Once a stone strikes (or misses) its target, the magic within it is discharged, and the stone reverts to normal.",

    "description": "Developed by priests of Abadar to catch thieves and skimmers, gilded whispers later spread to other faiths and was adapted to the arcane arts through the combined efforts of Aram Zey and Kreighton Shaine. Pathfinders most commonly use this spell to track bribes and illicit purchases back to their ultimate source, especially when they suspect the influence of Aspis Consortium agents.\n\nGilded whispers allows you to use a single coin as a conduit for an eavesdropping spell. When you use a divination (scrying) spell or item, such as clairvoyance/clairaudience, scrying, or a crystal ball, you can choose to target a coin you have affected with gilded whispers instead of a creature or location (even if you would not otherwise be able to target an object), though any range limits on the scrying effect still apply. If the coin is held or carried by a creature, its owner receives any applicable saving throw against the effect. The caster of gilded whispers treats the coin as a familiar subject. The residual psychic impressions left upon the coin by other handlers help mask this dweomer from detection, protecting gilded whispers against location by detect magic, arcane sight, and similar effects unless the latter spell’s caster succeeds on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast gilded whispers. The scrying sensor created by using a divination (scrying) spell to observe or listen to the coin’s surroundings can be detected as normal.",

    "description": "You create an artificial glacier that slowly moves in any direction that you choose at the time of casting; however, once set in motion, the glacier continues moving in the designated direction until the spell's duration expires or an intervening barrier prevents it from moving any further. The ice moves at a rate of 5 ft. per round, and slowly crushes any immobile creatures, objects and structures in its path. When the glacier comes into contact with any immobile object or structure, the glacier deals 25d6 points of damage. If the object or structure withstands the damage, the glacier's progress is halted in that particular location. Creatures unable to escape its path also take 25d6 points of cold and crushing damage (50% each) and are entitled to a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half. They are subsequently buried within the glacier and take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from the glacier's weight and 1d6 points of cold damage per minute within the ice. Targets rendered unconscious must make a Constitution check (DC 15 + 1 per previous check) each minute or suffer 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. In addition to the aforementioned physical damage, a buried creature also lacks breathable air and immediately starts suffocating. Small objects are simply swept away and entombed inside of the glacier. \n\nEach 10-foot square of glacier has 90 hp. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall reduced to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature (including a buried creature) tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the glacier) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save). Fire can melt a glacial slide, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a glacial slide creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.",

    "description": "This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded. When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead, polymorph, and nondetection (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).\n\nNote: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding. Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.\n\nBlast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.\n\nSpell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph.",

With a melee touch attack, you transfer one or more spells from the target to yourself.\n\nRoll a 1d6: The result equals the level of the spell or spells transferred. If the victim does not have a spell of that level, you receive one of its highest level spells and an additional spell of the roll's remainder. You may cast stolen spells once using this spell's effects.\n\nFor instance, if you roll a five and the target's highest spell level is 3rd-level, then you receive a 3rd-level spell and a 2nd-level spell. You can steal from either an arcane or divine spell slot and from either a caster who prepares spells or casts them spontaneously. If you steal from a spontaneous caster, treat it as if it had expended a spell of the stolen one's level. If no spell of the appropriate level is currently prepared or if a spontaneous caster has no more spells of that level available, this spell has no effect.\n\nThe theft deals the target 1 hp of damage per level of the spell or spells stolen. Normally you steal spells at random, but if you desire you may steal a particular spell you suspect the caster has prepared or available. In this case, if successful you receive only the target spell if the caster has it prepared or available. If not, this spell fails.\n\nYou may cast the stolen spell as normal, but the transferred magic functions as if cast by the target, not you, and you may not apply metamagic feats to it. You automatically receive knowledge of any verbal and somatic components required. You do not retain this information, however, after the stolen spell is cast.\n\nYou do not need material components to cast a stolen spell if they are worth 1 gp or less, but you must supply any more expensive. The target may not prepare spells using the stolen slot or slots and loses an appropriate spontaneous slot until they receive a break enchantment, dispel magic, or remove curse.These all removes the spell from the thief as well, if it has not been cast. If the victim is a prepared caster, it may prepare the same spell using a different slot.",

Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A guardian's tomb cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.\n\nThe range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 17th-level caster can command a guardian's tomb to respond to triggers as far as 255 feet away.

When the description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away he is, as detailed on the following table.\n\nDistance - Time to Locate\n100 ft. or less - 1 round\n1,000 ft. - 1 minute\n1 mile - 10 minutes\n2 miles - 1 hour\n3 miles - 2 hours\n4 miles - 3 hours\n5 miles - 4 hours\n\nOnce the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it.

The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears. The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to locate you. If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject. If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears. The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits.

In addition, once per round as a free action the target can gain an insight bonus to damage equal to its base attack bonus (minimum +1) to a single melee attack.

If the intended wearer is immersed in water when you cast this spell, you may form the armor around the wearer (who may be you); otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally. Attacks against the wearer that create heat or fire degrade the armor, reducing its armor bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when the armor's bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends. Because the ice is slightly buoyant, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Swim checks, except when swimming downward. Druids can wear ice armor without penalty.",

Roll once on Tables 15-25 and 15-26 on page 534 of the Core Rulebook to determine what the item's special purpose and dedicated powers are. These d% rolls are not modified by your caster level or any additional powdered gems you used to cast the spell.\n\nOnce this spell ends, the item reverts to its previous nature - if you cast this spell on the item again, it gains entirely different powers as determined by a new set of rolls.",

    "description": "This spell infuses an effigy with a powerful curse that targets a specific type of creature associated in some way with the effigy itself. When you cast this spell, it remains in effect until it is discharged. Once you cast infuse effigy, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it or cast another spell with its spell slot until you dismiss the infuse effigy spell or until it is discharged against a foe. If the number of 4th-level spells that you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of infuse effigy spells, the more recently cast infuse effigy spells in excess of the number of 4th-level spells you can now cast are dispelled.\n\nThe nature of the curse that becomes infused into the effigy you touch depends more on the nature of the effigy than anything else. You can cast this spell on a standard effigy (such as a head stuck onto a spike, or on a body hanging from a tree), but can generate more powerful effects by casting the spell on one of the more elaborate effigies detailed above - in this case, it is the established traditions of the effigy as much as the effigy itself that empowers the curse. The larger effigies, such as the tree of souls and the wicker man, have minimum caster level requirements; you must be this level or higher in order to cast infuse effigy on such a target.\n\nOnce an effigy is infused, it radiates an aura of unease to a radius of 5 feet per caster level - the first time a creature enters this area, it must make a Will save or become shaken for 1 minute per caster level. This effect can only occur once per creature and is a mind-affecting fear effect. As long as an effigy remains under the effects of this spell, the body parts associated with the effigy become preserved as if by gentle repose. Once an effigy has been the focus for an infuse effigy spell, it can never again be the target of this spell - a new effigy must be constructed from new victims if you wish to recreate it. An infused effigy is treated as a magic item for the purposes of saving throws.\n\nAn infused effigy has an additional effect on creatures of the same type as the largest creature incorporated into the effigy. If the largest creature is a humanoid or outsider, the additional effect only affects creatures of the largest creature's subtype. Creatures of this type (and subtype) take a -2 penalty on the saving throw against the effigy's aura, and as soon as such creatures attack or damage the effigy (from any distance) or approach within 10 feet of it, they must make a Will saving throw or become cursed. If a creature becomes cursed by an infused effigy, the spell effect on the effigy ends (and the caster can now use that spell slot to prepare or cast spells again), but the curse itself is permanent until it is removed. If the creature that triggers the effigy was close friends with or related to anyone whose body was used to construct the effigy, that creature takes a -4 penalty on the Will save to avoid becoming cursed. The specific effects of each type of effigy's curse are listed below. At the GM's discretion, other specific effigies might exist, along with specific effects they exhibit when they are the subject of an infuse effigy spell.\n\nStandard Effigy Curse (no minimum CL): -2 penalty to an ability score chosen by the caster.\n\nBlood Eagle Curse (no minimum CL): -4 penalty to Constitution and -4 penalty on all saving throws against fear effects.\n\nNithing Pole Curse (no minimum CL): Any effect that can be generated by a bestow curse spell.\n\nTree of Souls Curse (minimum CL 11th): The victim heals damage from rest at half normal rate, and any magical healing applied to the victim must succeed at a DC 20 Caster Level check or be negated. The cursed victim takes a -4 penalty on all Constitution-based checks, including stabilization checks and Fortitude saving throws.\n\nWicker Man Curse (minimum CL 15th): -6 penalty to two ability scores chosen by the caster. In addition, each time the victim takes damage from any source, it takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage as its flesh burns and blisters around the wound. It takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against fire effects. Unless it has the Fire subtype, the victim loses any racial resistance or immunity to fire.",

Creatures that fail this save by 5 or more become shaken for 10 rounds, while those that fail by 10 or more are panicked for 10 rounds and then shaken for 1d10 hours thereafter.\n\nCreatures of the animal type, while not subject to the insanity points imposed by the spell, will not willingly approach within 30 feet of the Yellow Sign; if forced to do so, they become panicked for as long as they remain within 30 feet.\n\nSpecial You must have 5 or more insanity points to cast the spell.",

    "description": "By holding aloft a holy symbol and calling your deity’s name, you take on an aspect of that divinity. When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain’s benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell’s DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round—this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell’s duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end.\n\nYou must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells. If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity’s precepts while under this spell’s effects, invoke deity immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Invoke deity has the same alignment descriptors ([chaotic], [evil], [good], or [lawful]) as your deity’s alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your invoke deity spell.\n\nAir: You become wispy and translucent. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability, or you increase your current fly speed by 30 feet—whichever results in a faster speed. While flying, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC.\n\nAnimal: Your form becomes bestial with animalistic features. You gain low-light vision, scent, a +6 natural armor bonus, and a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size. If you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you increased one size category. You can use speak with animals at will.\n\nArtifice: Parts of your body are replaced by pistons and gears. You can be affected by spells that specifically affect constructs (such as make whole). You are immune to bleed, disease, and poison effects, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, mind-affecting effects, and necromancy effects.\n\nChaos: Your flesh churns and swirls chaotically. You are immune to additional damage from critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack damage), and weapons you wield count as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n\nCharm: You become overwhelmingly attractive and persuasive. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma.\n\nCommunity: Your voice echoes with the sound of multitudes. Select a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your level divided by three—you gain the effects of status and telepathic bond with those creatures.\n\nDarkness: Your eyes become solid black orbs. You become immune to blindness and can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell.\n\nDeath: Your flesh becomes pallid. You are healed by both positive and negative energy, are immune to energy drain and death effects, and automatically stabilize when reduced below 0 hit points.\n\nDestruction: The air around you crackles. You gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with two-handed melee weapons. Spells you cast that cause hit point damage have their save DCs (if any) increased by 1. You gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to break objects, and you ignore the first 5 points of hardness any object has when you attack it with a melee weapon.\n\nEarth: Your flesh becomes stony. You gain DR 10/bludgeoning and are immune to petrification effects.\n\nEvil: Your appearance becomes corrupted and fiendish. You automatically confirm critical hits, and weapons you wield count as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n\nFire: Your hair ignites into flames. You are immune to fire. As a standard action once per minute, you can fire a ray of flame, as per scorching ray (limit one ray).\n\nGlory: Your countenance becomes stern and implacable, and your wrath devastates the undead. You gain the benefits of heroism and protection from evil, and your first successful attack each round against an undead target deals an additional 1d6 points of positive energy damage.\n\nGood: Your appearance becomes pristine and angelic. You are immune to fear and compulsion effects, and weapons you wield count as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n\nHealing: Your appearance becomes hale and hearty. You gain fast healing 3, and your spells and class features that restore hit points each restore an additional 1d8 hit points.\n\nKnowledge: You are surrounded by the sound of numerous turning pages. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.\n\nLaw: A haze of mathematical symbols hovers around you. You ",

However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).\n\nYou gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a -6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 35% and a -6 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.\n\nYour unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.\n\nYour weight increases by a factor of 10, causing you to sink in water like a stone.

    "description": "This powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma’s judgment, returning a willing petitioner to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell’s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.\n\nThe casting of judgment undone is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell’s 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless judgment undone has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment—how successful she may be depends on the GM’s discretion.\n\nThe caster of judgment undone can pause the spell’s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on judgment undone and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.\n\nIt is possible to cast judgment undone without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM’s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast judgment undone is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it’s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell’s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell’s material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma’s code of conduct.",

For the duration of the spell, you can sense the location, movement, and size of creatures of this type in the area, though you can’t discern species or individual identity. In addition, you improve the starting attitude of animals of the chosen type by one step for the duration of the spell.\n\nAs a full-round action, you may focus on a single animal that you can sense with this spell to establish a mental link. You can read the animal’s surface thoughts as detect thoughts, and can see, hear, and smell what the animal is experiencing using your own Perception skill. If you target another creature’s animal companion, the spell ends if the animal succeeds at a Will save. Using this ability reduces the spell’s remaining duration to 1 round/level, and the selected animal is treated as the scrying sensor.\n\nDespite the name, jungle mind functions within any terrain.",

At any one time during the spell's duration, the caster may react  to an event before it happens. The instant someone declares an action the character wishes to prevent, or a die roll comes up in a way the player doesn't like, he may declare it as the event he foresaw, and may take a single standard action just before it happens. This works like a readied action, in that it may interrupt or prevent the action triggering it. He may make an attack, cast a spell, move out of the way, or simply shout a warning. Of course, the character must still make any applicable rolls to see if his preemptive action worked. Further, if the action does not work, any relevant rolls stand - they need not be rerolled. For instance, during combat, a giant scorpion stings the caster's ally, a rogue, poisoning him. The caster had kismet's whisper cast, and so declares he saw the sting coming and uses his extra action to disintegrate the scorpion before the attack lands. Should the scorpion makes its save against the spell, and the resulting damage does not kill it, it will sting the rogue anyway, as the dice already indicated its attack hit and the rogue failed his save. \n\nWhen the caster declares the use of this ability, the spell is ended and only one event may be foreseen per casting.",

    "description": "From your lips, brightly glowing runes fall and coalesce in your hand, gathering in such a way as to form a thick and long whip made of multicolored force. When you cast this spell, a shimmering multihued whip of force comes into being in your hand. This can be used as a normal whip, but it has several unique properties. You are treated as proficient when wielding this whip, and you do not suffer any penalty for attacking a foe in melee with another creature. The whip deals 3d6 points of damage upon a successful touch attack and since it is made of force, it can hit ethereal and incorporeal targets, bypassing all damage reduction (but not hardness). There is no save against this aspect of the spell. \n\nIf an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the infernal whip strikes it. If the whip is successfully resisted, it has no further effect on that creature. \n\nIf not, the whip can strike that creature, which cannot apply SR to the whip's additional abilities (although it gets saves against these abilities as normal). If you release the whip, it vanishes, but you can recall it to your hand as a free action so long as the duration of the spell has not expired and it has not been dispelled. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The whip cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. In addition, each time you damage a foe with the whip, it produces one of several spell-like effects listed in the table that follows. All effects target only the creature damaged by the whip. The save DC is equal to the spell's DC.\n\nRoll    Effect 1         Lust: as sympathy (Will negates) 2         Gluttony: as vampiric touch 3         Greed: as teleport object (any object attended by opponent, Will negates) 4          Sloth: inflicts Exhausted condition (no save) 5          Wrath: 80 points sonic damage and inflicts Stunned condition for 1 round (Fortitude halves damage and negates the Stunned condition) 6          Envy: reduces highest ability score to 1 (as bestow curse, Will negates) 7          Pride: caster gains benefit of greater heroism 8          Roll Twice (ignoring rolls of 8)",

A creature that succeeds at the saving throw against your claw’s negative level is immune to further negative levels inflicted from this casting of lash of the astradaemon but not to the claw’s damage.

Invisible undead are not made visible by this effect, but the light does make it easy to pinpoint the exact squares in which such undead are located (they still retain the 50% miss chance granted by invisibility). The light of Iomedae increases light levels by one step in a 5-foot radius around an affected undead creature. Once an undead is affected, it remains illuminated as long as remains within the spell's range, even if it leaves the spell's original radius, until the spell's duration ends.\n\nAffected undead must also make a Will save when they are first illuminated by the light of Iomedae. Those who fail this save lose all benefits of channel resistance and take a -2 penalty on all saving throws made against positive energy effects.",

    "description": "All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from evil spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram - even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.",

The transformation is always a spectacular affair; the subject appears to be struck by lightning, or engulfed in flames, or glow with otherworldly energy. The display is sufficient to immediately ruin any attempt to hide, and grants a +10 circumstance bonus to the Perception checks of anyone who simply hasn't noticed the subject's presence. \n\nThe avatar looks only slightly like the subject's normal form. It is always in the prime of life, even if the subject is younger or older, and is obviously virile and powerful. The avatar displays an obvious magical nature, the exact details of which depend on the deity or power that created the avatar; the subject may crackle with an aura of electricity, or have eyes of flame and skin of steel, or any other mystic appearance (subject to GM approval). The avatar is different enough from the subject's normal countenance that it counts as a disguise, even granting a +10 circumstance bonus to the Disguise skill check if someone might recognize him.\n\nThe subject is healed as by a heal spell and gains darkvision out to 60 feet. The subject also gain a +10 size bonus to Strength, a +8 size bonus to Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, and gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to the spellcaster's caster level. \n\nFor the duration of the effect, while in avatar form, damage the avatar form takes is treated as if it were dealt to a different character and is taken from this separate set of hit points, rather than the caster's own hit points, as are all effects up to and including death (which ends the spell, returning the subject to its original form, in the same location where the avatar was slain). If the avatar is reduced to negative hit points or is slain, the subject immediately reverts to normal form. All equipment carried by the caster changes appearance slightly to match the avatar's overall image (and new size, if the avatar form is larger or smaller), but is otherwise unaffected. \n\nThe avatar is immune to ability drain, ability damage, disease, energy drain, poison, and polymorph; any of these effects that have taken hold on the subject are suppressed while in avatar form. Any other spell or ability affecting the subject also affects the avatar when it is taken. An anti-magic field suppresses the avatar form as long as the subject remains within, but the avatar form returns if the caster leaves the area (it does not count against the duration of the effect). \n\nAt the end of this effect's duration, the subject reverts back to his normal shape, and is fatigued for an amount of time equal to the length of time he held avatar form. The subject can also return to normal form voluntarily, which will naturally shorten the duration of his fatigue. \n\nYou can only be subject to one mark of the avatar at a time, and you cannot cast this spell gain until the spell has discharged and the duration of the avatar form is expired, If the avatar form is slain, the caster can never again cast this spell, as if it was not part of his spell list.",

    "description": "This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the Abyss. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the maw of chaos attempts a drag combat maneuver check against every creature within 40 feet, using your caster level plus your primary spellcasting ability modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged into a maw of chaos, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can occur per round.\n\nCreatures dragged adjacent to the maw of chaos become entangled by the frayed strands of reality being torn apart at the rim of the maw of chaos. Escape requires a successful Escape Artist check or grapple check against a DC equal to 10 plus the spell's save DC. Every creature without the chaotic subtype that ends its turn adjacent to a maw of chaos takes 2 points of damage to each ability score. Creatures with the lawful subtype take double this amount of damage; creatures with the chaotic subtype take no damage.\n\nCalling, summoning, and teleportation effects used within 30 feet of the maw of chaos or that cause a creature to appear within 30 feet of a maw of chaos are redirected, causing the creature to arrive adjacent to the maw of chaos rather than at its intended destination. Unattended objects (including dead bodies) adjacent to the maw of chaos are drawn into it and affected as by disintegrate at the beginning of the caster's next turn.",

When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted. While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded.

Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage. Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage. The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying. Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. Stone shape deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, passwall expels you without damage.",

Mirrored oracle does not provide the character any specific or even vague knowledge about his future. Instead, the character experiences a strange sense of deja vu throughout the spell's duration.

An insight bonus added to his AC only applies to one attack made against him. For instance, a mirrored oracle spell cast by a 17th level cleric grants the recipient a total insight bonus of +17. If the character adds a +5 insight bonus to a saving throw, a +3 insight bonus to an attack roll and a +3 insight bonus to AC, he still has a +6 bonus that he can add to any one die roll or to multiple die rolls as long as the cumulative bonus does not exceed +6.

Creatures that possess damage reduction 5 or greater that is not overcome by bludgeoning damage are immune to this spell and its effects. In addition, all creatures in other adjacent squares take 1 point of splash damage per caster levels as the object shatters on impact and then disappears.

The spell only affects willing participants that have signed the contract and is typically employed as a means of ensuring trustworthiness rather than enforcing the terms of the contract. At the time of the casting, all of the willing participants that signed the contract must be within the same enclosed space as the contract. (The exclusion of unwilling participants does not negate the spell.) From that point forward, all of the spell's recipients receive a brief, visual image showing the individual that broke the terms of the contract, and how he violated the terms of the agreement. Alternatively, a recipient can dismiss the spell's effects upon him at any time, although all of the remaining recipients become aware of his action as if he violated the contract. The GM has sole discretion when determining if the spell's conditions have been met and the precise nature of the information provided by the spell.",

Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the Dead Roads offer a shorter route. You can exit the Dead Roads at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available.\n\nBecause the Dead Roads occupy another plane, it is impossible to spy on the Material Plane while using this spell without additional spells or supernatural abilities.\n\nOpen the Dead Roads can be used to travel to or from the Shadow Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane, or the Boneyard; any of these destinations requires 10 hours of travel. Thanks to their unique nature, the Dead Roads can be used to travel from any plane to the Material Plane — a trip likewise requiring 10 hours — unless that plane normally bars all extraplanar travel.\n\nCreatures you bring with you to the Dead Roads are not obligated to follow you.

    "description": "By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services. The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment,  while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment. At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).\n\nNote: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.",

    "description": "Although he was hardly the first to turn to the Outer Planes for answers, Jatembe’s dealings with outsiders in his pursuit of enlightenment are legendary, and the Magaambya credits the Old-Mage with the creation of this spell.\n\nThis spell calls a creature from another plane to your precise location, functioning like lesser planar ally except as noted. When you call a creature using planar inquiry, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing). After hearing your request, if the creature has an appropriate Knowledge skill, it can attempt a check to provide the information it has. If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 + your caster level, and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane. If the creature is attacked or damaged at any time during the spell’s duration, the spell ends and the creature returns to the plane from which you summoned it.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can choose a specific kind of outsider to call, even calling an individual creature by name. The kind of outsider called doesn’t alter the effects of the spell, but when you use planar inquiry to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, the spell gains that descriptor. You cannot call an outsider whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level (maximum 18 HD) and you cannot use this spell to contact a unique outsider (such as a deity’s herald) or an outsider with mythic ranks.",

This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature’s highest-level activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it, but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature’s spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial spell-like abilities of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like invisibility (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for greater teleport (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing summon monster II (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can’t store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.\n\nThe save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of dominate person. The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round’s worth of actions.\n\nIf the sacrificed creature doesn’t die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell’s duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power. The fragment of the creature’s spirit trapped in the bloodstone does not hinder attempts to restore the creature to life.",

    "description": "The cultists of Tanoth-Gha venerate a primordial being whose existence predates the rise of more modern religions, even those of civilizations now thought ancient. To those who worship in his name he therefore is able to grant the power to interrupt the flow of divine energies of beings less ancient than he. This spell can be used in three ways.\n\nArea Interdiction: You can cut off an area from the power of other divinities, creating an emanation that interferes with the ability of creatures to cast divine spells, channel positive and negative energy (or use variant channeling effects), and activate supernatural or spell-like domain powers or other class abilities of divine spellcasting classes. A creature wishing to use such an ability must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 plus your caster level. This DC is increased by 1 for every 5 points of your Madness score (as above). If the check fails, the spell or ability is wasted without effect. It has no effect on magic items, except for spell-completion and spelltrigger items that create divine spells, in which case the item must make the caster level check. If this spell is cast on a permanent desecrated or unhallowed shrine or altar of Tanoth-Gha, the area of effect is increased to a 20-foot-radius spread.\n\nDivine Dispelling: You can use primeval interdiction just as you would greater dispel magic, but it affects only divine spells and spell-like abilities. You can add 1 to your caster level checks to dispel for every 5 points of your Madness score.\n\nTargeted Interdiction: You can bar a single creature from casting divine spells for 24 hours by making a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 plus the target’s caster level, with a +1 bonus to this check for every 5 points of your Madness score. If you succeed at this caster level check, the target cannot cast divine spells, prepare divine spells or spell slots, channel positive or negative energy (or an equivalent variant channeling ability), or to activate supernatural or spell-like domain abilities. Exceptional domain abilities and supernatural domain abilities that are constant in effect and do not require activation function normally. A successful Will save allows the target to continue to use these abilities, though the target’s effective divine class level is reduced by an amount equal to 1/3 your caster level for determining the effects of any divine spells or spell-like or supernatural abilities. It does not eliminate access to any abilities possessed by the target; it simply causes them to operate with reduced effect.\n\nDivine spells with the mythos descriptor are unaffected by primordial interdiction.",

    "description": "You call upon the earth to reach forth and seize your foes. To be affected, a creature within the spell's area must be within 10 feet of the ground, or in contact with another earthen or stone surface. When you cast this spell, massive clawed hands of stone erupt from the ground to snatch at creatures in the area. Make a melee touch attack against each creature with a +5- circumstance bonus. If a touch attack hits, that hand partially fuses with the opponent's body and makes a combat maneuver check (CMB equal to your caster level plus your caster ability modifier plus a +5 circumstance bonus).\n\nThe prison of stone attempts to dispel (as described in greater dispel magic) any and all spells or magic items on the touched creature that directly or indirectly interfere with the grapple or encapsulation (see below) taking effect. For example, a character casts prison of stone and touches a subject with freedom of movement. A dispel check is made (DC 11 + the caster level of the freedom of movement). If the dispel succeeds, the spell is dispelled before the grapple check is made. Prison of stone's dispelling can only affect spells cast upon a creature or object. Independent spell effects or those affecting an area cannot be dispelled, even if they prevent the prison of stone from affecting the touched creature. \n\nPrison of stone can dispel spells and magic items specifically intended to foil the spell in question (spell immunity), that provide general protection from spells (spell resistance), and/or offer any bonuses to combat maneuvers, grapples, or Escape Artist checks. You make a check for each instance of protection; an affected magic item is suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds. If the hand maintains the grapple, on the following round it attempts to pin the grappled opponent. A pinned creature takes 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage as the stone begins to spread and coalesce into a hard sphere of solid rock. One full round after the creature is pinned it is completely encapsulated in the sphere. It is held immobile and helpless, taking 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round from the pressure. It must also hold its breath or begin to suffocate. \n\nCreatures can attempt to break free from the grasping hands by succeeding on a DC 30 Strength check. Once the stone sphere has completely formed, the Strength check DC increases to 35. Once encapsulated a victim cannot use Escape Artist to break free of the prison of stone. \n\nDisintegrate, freedom or similar magic can destroy the stone sphere, as can dealing at least 50 points of damage to a sphere with a weapon (the stone has hardness 8). However, a trapped creature takes half of any damage dealt to the stone with weapon attacks.",

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. \n\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. \n\nSecond, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as charm person, command, and dominate person). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion. \n\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.",

    "description": "This spell grants the caster limited control over the quintessence of an Outer Plane. The control granted by quintessence mastery can take one of two forms, depending on the version of the spell cast. Both versions can be cast only on one of the nine Outer Planes, for it is these planes, not the Transitive or Inner Planes, that are comprised of quintessence.\n\nPlanewarp: This allows the caster to create various objects or effects. When this spell is cast, you can replicate a number of effects from one or more of the following spells: control water, diminish plants, fog cloud, major creation, move earth, plant growth, secure shelter, soften earth and stone, spike growth, spike stones, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wall of stone, or wall of thorns. The total spell levels of effects to be created must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of fog cloud, secure shelter, and soften earth and stone (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or diminish plants and spike stones (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not move earth and plant growth (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level—control water, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it’s a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM’s discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended.\n\nShape Realm: This functions similarly to create demiplane[UM], except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane’s traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM’s discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the create demiplane spell may limit this spell’s effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This version of quintessence mastery can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as create demiplane. This version of quintessence mastery does not function within the boundaries of a divine realm.",

A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.

To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar or animal companion that is touching the subject). You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the refuge spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.",

    "description": "You cast the target out of your religion as a curse and punishment for acts or misdeeds against the tenets of your faith. This has three effects. First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark). Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, cure light wounds cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast prayer, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target's friendship with the cleric. Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target. This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down. This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use atonement to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; remove curse also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation.",

Each round, you can do one of the following:\n\n• Study an area no larger than a 10-foot cube and see all secret doors hidden by any means. You also see through mundane disguises and spot creatures that are hiding.\n\n• Study a single creature or object and see all auras the creature has, including its alignment and any magical auras. You know the strength of any alignment or magical auras revealed (as detect chaos/evil/good/law and detect magic). Identifying a magic aura's school requires a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level), which you make as a free action. No magical effects short of a mind blank or the direct intervention of a deity will keep you from noting a subject's aura.\n\n• Study a single creature and know whether it is currently under a curse or any form of magical or mental control. When this spell reveals such effects, you can attempt to discern the location and identity of whatever entity laid the curse or established the control (if entity is on the same plane as you at the time you cast the spell). The entity gets a Will save to negate this effect, but if the save fails, you know its name and approximate location (as though you had used a discern location spell against a creature you have seen). If the entity has more than one name, you learn either the name by which the subject of the curse or control knows the entity, or the name the entity most commonly uses in public, as applicable.\n\n• Study a single creature and know whether it is currently capable of assuming a different form (via a special quality, magic item, or a spell available for casting) and any limitations on what those forms can be. For example, you could detect the true nature of a lycanthrope or doppelganger, or sense that the sorcerer you face knows alter self and has a 2nd-level spell slot available with which to cast it). The creature is allowed a Will save to negate this effect.\n\n• Study one creature and know whether it is living or nonliving, and whether a nonliving creature is undead or a construct. You also know the creature's condition, as though you had used detect animals or plants. \n\nFor uses of the spell that allow it, a successful Will save makes the target creature immune to the current casting of the spell. You know that a creature has successfully saved and can attempt to study it again, but you must cast the spell again to do so. Any use of this spell that allows a Will save is blocked by a mind blank effect or the direct intervention of a deity.

This animated suit of armor still contains the unconscious (or dead) body of its former wearer and moves with a shambling gait at a speed of 20 feet.

Once animated, the revenant armor remains standing (and stands if knocked prone, doing so without provoking attacks of opportunity), and prevents the wearer of the armor from being considered helpless. If an ally of the wearer is within range of the armor, she can direct it to move, though it refuses to go anywhere that requires a skill check. If grappled or otherwise restrained, it can attempt to break free with a Strength score equal to your caster level and a CMB equal to 1 + your caster level + the armor’s Strength modifier.

Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface—you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must make a Reflex save to avoid falling into the rift. If the Reflex save is successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects or structures fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.\n\nThe walls of the rift are covered by razor-sharp blades, while the rift floor seethes with strange chewing vermin, boiling pools of acid, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the pit takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the pit (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the pit’s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the pit rather than at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round, and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the pit can make a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The pit’s walls have a Climb DC of 25.\n\nWhen this spell’s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift’s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.\n\nAt any time during the spell’s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens out into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell’s duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area—these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via summon monster VII, and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the rift of ruin spell. You can choose one of the following to be summoned: 1 bebilith, 1 vrock, 1d3 succubi, 1d3 shadow demons, 1d4+1 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraks.",

You gain DR 5/evil (if you normally channel positive energy) or DR 5/good (if you normally channel negative energy). At 15th level, this DR becomes 10/evil or 10/good (the maximum). Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category. This spell doesn't change your speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new size. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process (see Chapter 7 for rules on breaking objects). If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you - the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size. All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.",

    "description": "You trap the target in an object decorated with the holy symbols of your god or faith. While trapped in the object, the creature can’t take any actions and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a freedom, miracle, or wish spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object frees the creature.\n\nIf you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object. It immediately gains the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature now in possession of the object. It still can’t take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy).\n\nAfter 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature’s Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.\n\nAfter 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.\n\nAfter 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per possession[OA]. However, the creature can’t personally destroy the object, even while possessing another creature.\n\nBecause the binding magic irrevocably weakens the longer you’re away from the item, returning it to your ownership doesn’t reverse any of the effects. You must free the creature and impose another sacramental seal if you want to restrict its abilities again.\n\nIf the object is placed in the stewardship of creatures or a location belonging to your faith, it still counts as being out of your presence but it takes ten times longer for the creature to manifest the above abilities (it would take 10 weeks for it to manifest the ability to create haunts, for example).",

    "description": "You make a sacrifice to aid in conjuring and commanding a creature called with planar ally, planar binding, or a similar spell. A sacrifice can be used in a variety of ways:\n\nBargain: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being grants you a bonus on opposed Charisma checks made to compel the creature into service for the next hour.\n\nEnticement: Making a sacrifice the round before conjuring increases the DC of the Will save an outsider must make to resist being conjured.\n\nPayment: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being allows you to pay for one service from the creature in commodities other than gold.\n\nReinforcement: Making a sacrifice the round before casting magic circle and preparing a summoning diagram increases the power of its warding magic, increasing the DC of all Charisma checks the creature might make to escape. This lasts 1 day.\n\nMultiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in summoning and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect of a particular conjuration.\n\nA sacrifice may consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including treasures, living creatures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures prove more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to summon a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target - few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.\n\nThe table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts effect and the offering's equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of planar ally. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, lives, or even changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of miracle or wish. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature's choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifices table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (like a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.\n\nYou cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain two permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 HD worth of creatures to pay for a 10 HD creature's service.\n\nType - Sacrifice - Typical Bonus - GP Value\nTreasures - 100 gp/HD of target - +1 - Equal\nLives[1] - 1 living creature with HD equal to target - +2 - 200 gp/HD\nBody/Mind[1] - Permanent -1 ability drain - +4 - 500 gp/point drained\nMorals[2] - Alignment shifts one step toward target's - +6 - 1,000 gp/step\nSoul[1] - One permanent negative level - +8 - 2,500 gp\n[1]When used to sacrifice a life, body, mind, or soul other than the caster's own, this is an evil act.\n[2]A character can sacrifice only her own morals, and can do so only once per lifetime.",

While inside your target’s home, you gain a +10 insight bonus on Perception checks and gain the constant benefits of detect secret doors and find traps. You automatically see through any illusory walls in the target’s home.\n\n“Character” lets you know of a compromising detail about your target’s personal life, giving you a +10 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks when attempting to gather information about your contracted victim from other people. Your target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects you generate, and you gain a +4 bonus on caster level checks you attempt to overcome the target's spell resistance.\n\n“Weakness” grants you knowledge of physical vulnerabilities your target has, as well as information about the target’s damage reduction, immunities, and other defensive abilities. If these vulnerabilities and defenses change during the spell’s duration, you immediately know. You automatically confirm all critical threats against the target.\n\nOnce your victim is slain or a month has passed (whichever comes first), the information you gained from the spell fades. While you can recall certain elements of these memories, you no longer gain any of the benefits associated with the spell. You can only have one target affected by Sarzari shadow memory at any one time; if you cast this spell a second time while a previous casting is still active, the effects of the new spell replace the effects of the old one.",

    "description": "A scourge is an extremely powerful curse. It can be cast over a vast distance; as a result, it is often used to punish heretics and criminals who cannot be brought to face justice. When you cast scourge you can choose to duplicate any of the effects of a curse of lower level (curse spells are those that cannot be dispelled but can only be affected by break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, and/or wish) or you can select one of the following effects:\n\n• Acrimony - People can't explain why they don't like the victim; he just seems suspicious and hateful. NPC allies and friends can resist this somewhat, but will still find the character strangely repellent; they may suspect that he has been replaced by a doppelganger. In addition, any sort of spell used to detect alignment will always respond with the alignment most hostile to the caster, and discern lies will always show the victim as lying.\n\n• Aging - The victim ages one age category at the start of each day.\n\n• Barren Touch - Any food or drink touched by the victim spoils. Any plants he tills die. Any Heal checks he makes automatically fail, and any cure spells he casts have a 50% chance of becoming inflict spells of the same level.\n\n• Ignominy - Anyone who comes into contact with the victim will forget any noble or valorous deeds she has done, while clearly remembering any crimes she has committed or mistakes she has made. People will attribute the character's greatest achievements to other people (other party members, for example, or legendary heroes). If the curse is lifted, these memories will return.\n\n• Ostracism - The victim is surrounded by an aura that causes all NPCs to have a hostile attitude toward him. This also results in a permanent -6 penalty to the victim's Charisma score, to a minimum score of 1.\n\n• Poverty - Any precious metal that the victim touches turns to lead. \n\n• Prohibition - You specify a specific action that the victim cannot take. \"Do not lie\" or \"Do not physically hurt humans\" will work; impossible or broad requests like \"Do not breathe\" or \"Never hurt anyone in any way\" will not. Any time that the victim attempts the prohibited action, she must make a Will save (using the DC of the scourge). If she succeeds, she can perform the action unhindered; otherwise she is wracked with extreme pain suffering a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks (these penalties last for 1 hour); in addition she suffers from the Stunned condition for 1d4+1 rounds.\n\nYou can come up with similar effects with your GM's permission. \n\nWhen you cast the spell you must declare a set of circumstances that will cause the curse to be broken. Depending on the reasons for inflicting the scourge, this could range from \"save an innocent man from death\" or \"submit to Kheshite justice,\" to \"Defeat the demon lord Xarglbarg\" or even \"Find true love.\" The subject is automatically made aware of this escape clause and the clause is subject to GM approval. \n\nThis curse cannot be dispelled, and it can only be removed with a remove curse (which only grants a second saving throw, but if unsuccessful it has no additional effect), break enchantment (as remove curse), limited wish, miracle, or wish spell.",

While your senses are in the severed head, your body is blind and deaf until you spend a free action to shift your senses back to your own body.\n\nWhen you create the head, you can imprint it with a single triggering condition, similar to magic mouth. Once this triggering condition is set, it can never be changed. If you are within 30 feet of the head, you immediately know if it is triggered (if you have multiple active sentry skulls, you also know which one was triggered). This wakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb your concentration. For example, you could have a sentry skull alert you if any humanoid comes into view, if a particular rival approaches, if your guard animal is killed, and so on, as long as it occurs where the severed head can see it.\n\nThis spell does not give the head any ability to speak, think, or take any kind of action other than to turn itself, though it is a suitable target for other spells such as magic mouth.",

If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of duncolored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed. While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.

Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell’s casting, you can attempt a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw, locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead choose to have manacles restrain the target’s limbs in front of or behind it.\n\nIf you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can have a set of manacles bind the targets together.\n\nAs you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them.\n\nIf you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Huge restraints.\n\nIf you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints.

    "description": "When you cast sink land, the earth around you sinks and the water table rises. This creates a powerful shockwave and tidal rush and permanently alters the terrain near you.\n\nThe sinking effect lasts for 3 rounds, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. In the first and second rounds, the land sinks and movement and attacks are hampered; in the third round, water rushes into the area of the spell and speech, movement, and attacks are all prevented. Starting in the fourth round, creatures can move and act normally.\n\nSpellcasters on the ground must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spells they try to cast. Being underwater in the third round, spellcasters must follow the rules for underwater spellcasting (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook) and must also make the same concentration check for verbal components as in previous rounds.\n\nThe sinking land affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of a sink land spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast, as listed below.\n\nCave, cavern, or tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d8 hp damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 16 for half) and pinning that creature under the rubble (see text). Water floods the cavern or tunnel; creatures unable to breathe water must hold their breath until freed or drown.\n\nCliffs, hills, and mountains: Cliffs crumble and mountains sink by up to 10 ft./level. This creates a landslide or mudslide that travels 40 ft. for every 10 ft. it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d8 hp bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 16 for half) and is pinned under the rubble (see text). In addition, springs and melting snow or ice water spring forth from the hillside, turning the terrain to mud. The affected area slumps down and may form an alpine lake, ice field, or tarn if surrounded by higher terrain.\n\nOpen ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 16 Reflex save to successfully take a breath before plunging underwater; otherwise, they begin drowning and they drop held items. The sinking creates a large lake or waterhole in even the driest region. The lake is 10 ft. deep/level in marsh, swamp, plains, or urban terrain; 5 ft. deep/level in forests or jungle; and 5 ft. deep/2 levels in snowy tundra. In a desert, the sinking creates a marsh 5 ft. deep regardless of level and affects half the usual radius. If cast along a shoreline orcoast, the lake merges with the nearby body of water.\n\nStructures: Any structure on open ground takes 100 hp damage from sinking foundations and rushing floodwaters. This collapses a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 hp bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 16 for half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see text) below water level and may be subject to drowning.\n\nPinned under rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 hp nonlethal damage/minutes while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 hp lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.\n\nThe material component is the heartblood of an isonade (see Midgard Bestiary for Pathfinder RPG) or the heartblood of a similar epic leviathan or kraken.",

The barge can carry up to 400 pounds of weight per caster level. It flies at a rate of 5 feet per caster level, or twice that if the caster has at least six people manning the oars. Manning an oar is considered the equivalent of hustling, and characters will have to trade off and rest between sessions to keep the barge moving at full speed. When the spell duration ends, the barge instantly comes to a stop and drifts down to the ground. It vanishes upon contact with the earth (or water, or other surface), possibly leaving the passengers and cargo scattered. If the caster deliberately lands the barge before the duration expires, however, the barge does not vanish, and it can be unloaded in an orderly fashion, and it may lift off once again.",

While it’s possible to make crude objects with snow shape, most fine details aren’t possible. However, a successful Craft weapons) check allows you to create a bladed weapon from the snow. The DC of this check is equal to the DC listed with the Craft (weapons) skill (Core Rulebook 93). You must be the one to make the Craft check and must do so at the time of casting this spell. A failed check means that the spell is cast normally but the weapon created is malformed and useless. This spell can only be used to craft weapons and not more precise tools or elaborate armors.\n\nOnce you create the item with this spell, it solidifies into super-hard ice, gaining a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. This weapon takes double damage from fire. Anyone using an ice weapon takes a –2 penalty on attacks due to the slippery, unwieldy nature of the weapon, but the weapon deals 1 point of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. A weapon created by this spell lasts for 24 hours before melting into uselessness.",

The darkness completely obscures all sight, including darkvision. A creature within the cloud is considered to have full concealment; attacks suffer a 50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target. \n\nSolid darkness is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at one-tenth normal speed (minimum of 5 feet per round, though you cannot take a 5 foot step), and all melee attack and melee damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The darkness prevents effective ranged weapon attacks, except for magic rays and the like. A creature or object that falls into solid darkness is slowed, so that each 10 feet of darkness that the creature or object falls through reduces the damage of a fall by 1d6 points, with a minimum damage of 0. For example, if a creature falls 30 feet, then passes through 20 feet of solid darkness before striking the ground, the total damage of the fall is 5d6 - 2d6 (total fall of 50 feet, with 20 feet of the fall being through solid darkness). \n\nSolid darkness is charged with negative energy; any creature within it suffers 1 point of negative energy damage each round (no save). Undead or other negative-energy creatures within the darkness are instead healed 1 hit point per round.",

For the duration of soul current, whenever a creature connected to the soul current is affected by a spell that requires a Will save, or that has the [death] or [mind-affecting] descriptors, determine randomly which creature is affected. If a single spell affects several creatures, roll once for each creature that would have been affected.\n\nFor example, a 17th level necromancer links himself and five of his henchmen with soul current; as long as they remain within 1080 feet of the necromancer, they remain connected. If a cleric cast destruction on the necromancer, one random person of the six in the soul current will be affected, as long as they are within 1080 feet of the necromancer, even if they are beyond the normal range of destruction. If later the necromancer and all his companions are targeted by a mass charm, you would roll six times to determine which were affected.

    "description": "This spell functions exactly like imbue with spell ability, except that you can imbue the target with any spell you have prepared (instead of just abjuration, divination, or conjuration {healing} spells) and the target may have more than one use of the imbued spells, depending upon the arrangements made when it is cast.\n\nCasting this spell requires a contract between you and the target, explaining what spells are to be imbued and the circumstances that cause the contract to expire. The contract may be as simple as allowing the target one casting of each of the imbued spells (as per imbue with spell ability), or may continue for multiple days or even indefinitely, with the target regaining use of the imbued spells when you next prepare your own spells. You may include any proviso you see fit, such as requiring the target to pray to Asmodeus each morning, or restricting the target to only casting the imbued spells on himself. If the target does not agree to all the conditions in the contract, this spell fails when cast. The contract (and this spell) automatically expires if you or the target dies. While the contract remains in effect, you gain a profane bonus to your Armor Class, saving throws, and checks equal to the highestlevel spell you have imbued.\n\nOnce you cast this spell, you cannot prepare a new 5th-level spell to replace it until the contract expires. If the number of 5th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active lesser spellcasting contract spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.\n\nUnlike imbue with spell ability, how the target uses the spell has no reflection on your alignment or relationship with Asmodeus; the Prince of Darkness accepts that allowing another access to his magic for good may benefit his plans in the long run. Note that unlike imbue with spell ability, you cannot dismiss this spell; you must abide by the contract's termination clause (though the contract may include a proviso for at-will nullification by either or both parties). This spell cannot be combined with imbue with spell ability or similar spells to give a target more spells than the limit.\n\nExample: You cast this spell on your 5 HD fighter cohort after negotiating an appropriate contract, imbuing him with the ability to cast cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, and shield of faith once per day for 1 month. If he casts any of these spells, he recovers them when you prepare your spells. Until the contract ends, your 5th-level spell slot used to cast this spell remains expended and cannot be filled with a new spell. Because you imbued your cohort with a 2nd-level spell, you gain a +2 profane bonus to attacks, saves, and checks while the contract remains in effect.",

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).",

You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded (as a standard action you can learn the percentage of wounds/hp total), any special condition, extraordinary, supernatural, spell or spellability affecting them. As a move action you can see and hear through the eyes and listen through the ears of a single creature affected by this superior status. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distances between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it. \n\nYou can also cast a limited selection of spells through the link, as if you were touching the target. You can cast any non-personal divination spell, and any spell that meets the following conditions:\n\nLevel: 0, 1st, 2nd or 3rd Range: Touch or Close Target: Creature touched or one creature Saving Throw: harmless\n\nFor example, if you become aware (through the superior status spell) that one of your linked companions is dying, you can cast cure moderate wounds to try to revive her.",

Steal the painful memory allows you to strip away all memories of a particular event. You must be able to describe the event in approximately 12 words or less. For example, any of the following would work: \"Forget that Shaeryn ever existed\"; \"Forget that Shaeryn was murdered\"; or \"Forget that Prince Korrin murdered Shaeryn.\" The gap in memory will be filled in by the simplest solution, and all people affected by the spell will share this memory. Told to forget a murder, they will believe that the victim moved away; told to forget the identity of the murderer, they will believe that the crime was never solved or that the murderer was a stranger who escaped. \n\nThe targets of steal the painful memory must be linked in some way. They could be members of the same community, the same guild, the same religion, or the same party of adventurers. The power of the spell spreads out in a radius from your location until it reaches the maximum range.

    "description": "You step into any magical or naturally occurring storm and commune directly with the power of the wind and rain. This spell allows the storm’s power to fill you, granting you knowledge and images of what else lies within its reach. As long as you remain within the storm, you can concentrate on it for 1 minute to determine whether or not other living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher are caught in the storm within 400 feet of you. Due to the nature of the spell, you do not need to attempt concentration checks against violent wind or storms when casting the spell, but other elements that might disrupt spellcasting require checks as normal. While the spell is in effect, you no longer need to attempt concentration checks as a result of wind or storms for spells you cast or concentrate on.\n\nOnce you’ve sensed creatures with this spell by concentrating for 1 minute, you can continue concentrating to learn more. After you concentrate for 1 additional round, the spell reveals to you via winds and rain the presence of any Small or larger living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher within 400 feet of you. After 2 consecutive rounds of concentration, you learn the approximate distance to the detected life forms from your current location. After 3 rounds of concentration, the rain and winds allow you to determine the approximate direction of each life form. Once you’ve concentrated in this way for 3 rounds, you gain a bonus equal to half your caster level on your next initiative check during the spell’s duration.",

    "description": "When this spell is cast upon a vessel, the ship is surrounded by a protective bubble of constantly replenishing, breathable air and sinks beneath the waves. For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull & Shackles Player's Guide for details). The ship's pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell's effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel's normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.\n\nThe spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won't accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell's duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition. This spell has no effect if cast upon a ship in water that cannot cover the vessel entirely.\n\nAlthough largely beneficial, this spell can be cast on a ship whose pilot does not want to submerge her vessel. The ship itself uses its Will saving throw to resist this effect.",

It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-1. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish). When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10-1 marked with an \"*\" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \"*\" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.\n\nSummon Monster Tables\n1st Level: Dire rat*, Dog*, Dolphin*, Eagle*, Fire beetle*, Frog, poison*, Pony (horse)*, Viper (snake)*\n * This creature is summoned with the celestial template if you are good, or the fiendish template if you are evil; you may choose either if you are neutral.",

The ship comes with all equipment necessary for sailing or rowing the ship but provides no crew or cargo. If you attempt to conjure the ship into a location where there isn’t a sufficient amount of water to keep the ship afloat, the spell fails. The ship displaces all water and Medium or smaller aquatic animals within its space when it appears, but the location must be otherwise unoccupied at the time of casting the spell. You can cast this spell again to extend the duration of the conjured ship, replacing the remaining duration with the new spell’s duration. When the spell’s duration ends or the spell is dismissed, the ship instantly stops moving and then falls apart over the course of a minute.\n\nThe largest type of ship that you can summon depends on your caster level, as indicated by the table below.\n\nCaster Level - Ship Type Focus - Cost \n7th - Keelboat - 300 gp\n11th - Longship or sailing ship - 1,000 gp\n13th - Junk - 1,500 gp\n15th - Warship - 2,500 gp\n17th - Galley - 3,000 gp",

    "description": "Nexian wizards first created this spell while researching the nature of the Mana Wastes, hoping to create small zones within the magic-starved region where their own spells could still function reliably. The best the Nexians could manage was this spell - a method to temporarily stabilize magic so that spellcasting within a small area can be accomplished without fear of triggering primal magic events. In the area of effect of this spell, primal magic events cannot be triggered. The emanation grants a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against effects generated by primal magic outside of the spell's effect that expand into the area.\n\nUnfortunately, suppressed primal magic tends to build up around the emanation created by this spell. When suppress primal magic's duration ends (or when the spell is dispelled), a primal magic event is immediately triggered at the center of the emanation if that point is still in an area where primal magic is active. The CR of this event is equal to the caster level of the recently ended suppress primal magic spell. The original caster of the suppress primal magic spell can attempt to negate this triggered primal magic event by making a DC 20 Will save - most spellcasters instead relocate to an area not affected by primal magic if they can so that they can end the spell's effect safely.",

    "description": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.\n\nUntil it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.\n\nAs a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n\nIn this case, \"reading\" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n\nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.\n\nWhen scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\n\nYou also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n\nRead magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol's spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\n\nA symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.\n\nSymbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.\n\nNote: Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.\n\nAddition from Symbol of Condemnation: Causes attitude shift to unfriendly towards creature marke",

When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a wall of force. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the wall of force first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level. When scribing a symbol of sealing, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the symbol of sealing, but doing this extends the casting time as described under symbol of death (Core Rulebook 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned - the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered. A disintegrate spell or similar effect can destroy the wall of force created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A knock spell has no effect on a symbol of sealing or its force wall. A symbol of sealing cannot be dispelled, but mage's disjunction automatically destroys it.",

    "description": "You alter the area’s terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area’s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn’t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn’t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.\n\nYou can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.\n\nMultiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.\n\nThis spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.\n\nIf you’re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.",

Creatures in the area that fail their saves are caught up in the throes of the magic, believing themselves to be in the last desperate battle of a war against their most hated foes. On their next action, all affected creatures attack the nearest creature with their most damaging attack. This attack can be of any sort, so long as it is the most effective means of killing the nearest creature. Creatures in the area of effect must make a successful saving throw each round to avoid attacking the nearest creature. On the rounds following the casting, you can direct the tide of war to move in a straight line, sweeping up new creatures in its effect. You may take this free action once per round by making a simple gesture. The tide of war may be moved up to 30 feet per round in this fashion. Creatures in the areas the spell moves over, or that do not leave the area, must make saves to resist its effects.",

If cast upon a fog cloud, stinking cloud or a similar effect this spell either suppresses that effect for 1 round per level or adds freezing fog to its other effects (your choice).

Creatures in the targeted area must make a Reflex save to avoid being caught and immobilized. Escape requires a successful Strength or Escape Artist check against the spell's save DC. Affected creatures with the water subtype take no damage but are paralyzed for 1 round per level if they fail a Fortitude save. If successful, they are slowed for 1 round per level if they pass.\n\nEarth: You transform earth into permafrost, ending the duration of rock to mud or creating an effect similar to mud to rock. Creatures burrowing through the area do so at half their normal speed until the area thaws. If they can burrow through solid rock, their speed is unaffected.\n\nAffected creatures with the earth subtype take 1d4 hp damage per level because this spell generates stress fractures that riddle their bodies.\n\nFire: Fire is transformed into shards of ice, which function as caltrops if walked over. The ice melts normally and does not reignite unless it is part of the area of effect of an ongoing spell or similar effect. If that is the case, the flames return after 1 round per level.\n\nAffected creatures with the fire subtype take 1d8 hp damage per level.

Exceptionally heavy weights may cause the crust to break (see rules for crossing ice in chapter five of Northlands).\n\nAffected elemental creatures suffer damage or other negative effects depending on their subtype. Treat a creature with the water subtype as if the lava were water, a creature with the earth subtype as if the lava were earth, and so on.

Also unlike speak with dead, replies can be long-winded and complex if the questions call for it, such as the teaching of a spell or the recounting of a long tale. As always, the GM has the final word regarding what is possible to achieve using this spell. Casting this spell is a dangerous undertaking. Each question asked after the first grants the target a new saving throw. A successful saving throw allows the target to break free of the spell, after which it can choose to either attack the caster or return from whence it came. If the caster or his allies attack the summoned creature, the spell is automatically broken and the target is free to act as described above. If the target is killed, it disappears but is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform, during which time it can't be summoned again. Even if the target's initial saving throw is successful, the target may choose to answer the summoning and attack the caster. For this reason, this spell is often cast in conjunction with an inwardly focused magic circle against evil spell.

When this spell is cast, the subject may attempt a Reflex save. Success indicates that the vines fail to take root and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the subject's base speed is immediately reduced by 5 feet. Each round thereafter, the subject must make another successful Reflex save or his speed is reduced by another 5 feet. This occurs each round until he is reduced to a speed equal to half of what it was before the spell was cast.\n\nAs a full-round action, the subject or an adjacent creature can tear the vines off the subject's body, resetting the speed penalty to just 5 feet, though the vines continue to grow each round thereafter for the spell's duration, requiring additional checks, unless it is actually dispelled. The spell's effects can also be prematurely ended by dealing at least 20 points of fire damage to the subject. When the spell's duration ends or the effect is terminated, the vines immediately wilt and the subject's speed returns to normal. Regardless of the subject's base speed, the vines cannot reduce a creature's speed below 5 feet.\n\nThis spell has additional effects depending on which version you cast, chosen when you cast the spell.\n\nBlessed Thorns: The vines sprout vicious thorns made of celestial steel. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the subject takes 2d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage for each round since the creature last took a full-round action to tear the vines off. When you cast this version of the spell, you can also choose to make the thorns either cold iron or silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.\n\nNoxious Vines: The vines emit noxious fumes that act as a lung and eye irritant. The subject and any creatures adjacent to the subject must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude check each round at the beginning of their turn. On a failed save, the creatures becomes blinded for that round and can't cast spells with verbal components.\n\nSwift Vines: The vines act twice as quickly as normal, and slow the creature by 10 feet per round instead of 5 feet (though they still can't decrease the creature's speed to less than half). In addition, once the creature is slowed to half-speed, it becomes staggered until the vines are torn off or the spell ends.",

If a target has a fly speed, it can fly overland at the wind’s speed in the same direction as the wind by succeeding at a DC 20 Fly check. If a creature flying overland this way attempts to change direction, it risks being blown away as usual. By linking hands or creating a connection with rope, creatures affected by this spell can be towed through the air by a flying creature as if each weighed only one-eighth its actual weight.",

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.

On a failed check, the victim is swept away and to the top of the wall; if there is a barrier at the top of the wall, such as a ceiling, the creature is pinned by the force of the water (CMB or Escape Artist check DC = 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier to escape this pin effect). In addition, there is loose debris within the water, branches, twigs logs, rocks, and boulders that deal 8d6 points of damage per round to creatures within the wall (no save). Pulling out a character trapped by the water pressure can be difficult. A rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim.

    "description": "This spell harnesses the power of the seasons to protect the target and grant a number of bonuses. This spell has one of four different effects. The caster of the spell can select any one of the following four effects, but can change the effect as a standard action that reduces the total remaining duration by 1 hour.\n\nSpring: The target is wrapped in light vines, culminating in a crown of bright, beautiful flowers. While the spell remains in effect, the target is immune to bleed effects and regains 1 hit point per round whenever below 0 hit points, as long as the target is still alive. This stabilizes the target. For each hit point restored in this way, the spell's total remaining duration is reduced by 1 hour.\n\nSummer: The target is surrounded by tiny motes of light. While the spell remains in effect, the target's base speed increases 10 feet. The target may instead increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell's total remaining duration by 1 hour.\n\nFall: A cloak of autumn leaves appears on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by reducing the spell's total remaining duration by 1 hour.\n\nWinter: A flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces. The target can move freely through difficult terrain for 1 round by reducing the spell's remaining duration by 1 hour. Difficult terrain created by magic affects the target normally.",

    "description": "This inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A lesser ward can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature of a specific type violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores. Wards can be set according to alignment, creature type, subtype, or species (such as \"elf\" or \"aberration\"). Wards also can be set to pass those of your religion or organization. They cannot be set according to appearance, class, Hit Dice, or level. Wards respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple lesser wards cannot function within 30 feet of each other. When casting the spell, you mark a clear design in paint, chalk, blood, scratch marks, or some other means. The ward can conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the ward remains quite obvious. Wards can be detected as traps (DC 10 + caster level) and disabled or bypassed (same DC); in addition they can also be dispelled. The non-detection spell can fool a ward. You can identify a lesser ward with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15). Identifying the ward does not discharge it, but it allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version [see below], type of damage caused, what spell is stored). \n\nDepending on the version selected, a ward either blasts the intruder or activates a spell:\n\nBlast Ward: A blast deals 2d4 points of damage to one target. This damage is acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (your choice, made at time of casting). Those affected can make Reflex saves to take half damage.\n\nSpell Ward: You can store any harmful 1st level spell that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your level at the time of casting. If the spell has targets, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect (such as a cloud), the area or effect centers on the intruder. All saves operate as normal, except that the Difficulty Class is based on the level and school of the lesser ward.",

Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim’s mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject’s Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces of the waters of Lamashtu—enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon.\n\n The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the waters of Lamashtu (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM’s discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).",

The weapon of death floats at the side of the caster and follows her wherever she goes. The ghostly weapon acts as a conduit between the Negative Energy Plane and the Material Plane and can be used to deliver life-draining attacks on living creatures or to heal undead via a successful touch attack. \n\nAs a swift action or as part of the initial casting, the caster can send the weapon of death outward up to 15 feet away from her and have it attack any target within that range. Once the hammer begins attacking a particular target it will continue to attack that target without requiring concentration or additional actions from the caster. Switching targets is a swift action. The weapon of death otherwise behaves like a spiritual weapon in terms of its movement and range. \n\nThe weapon of death attacks once per round, and deals 3d6 points of negative energy damage, plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) upon a successful touch attack. Whenever a living creature is touched by the weapon of death it suffers 1 negative level. Undead creatures touched by the weapon suffer no damage and are instead healed of the damage that the weapon of death would have dealt. \n\nIf the weapon of death slays the target, it consumes the remains utterly in holy (or unholy) fire (but not its equipment or possessions). \n\nSpells or items that ward against negative energy and/or energy drain can protect a creature against this spell's effects. However, each time the weapon of death strikes a creature that is warded against negative energy or energy drain, the caster may make an immediate caster level check to dispel the warding effect, exactly as if the weapon of death were a targeted dispel magic against the warding effect.",

    "description": "With this powerful spell the spellcaster can quietly and subtly control the thoughts of others. The caster must have a personal object or piece of the target (such as clothing, hair, fingernail clippings, etc.) with which to channel the spell. In addition, the caster must remain within the range for the duration of the casting. At the beginning of the enchantment, the caster names the target and from then on, uses the second person to refer to the target, as if talking directly to the target. The target begins to hear incessant, unintelligible whispering that wears down his defenses. Nothing stops the whispering, not even a silence spell, because the effect is in the target's mind. Mind blank stops the effects of the spell, but not the bother of the whispering. During the casting, the cleric must specify how the target will be affected:\n\nEmotions: There are five emotions that the spell can create: fear, anger, peace, hate and love.\n\n• Fear: The target feels an overriding sense of fear and dread. This fear cannot be defined and is not specific to any one thing; however, it wears away at the target, causing a -3 morale penalty to all skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.\n\n• Anger: An intense sense of rage and anger invades the thoughts of the target. He is liable to lash out at friends and foes alike. Those things that are normally just slight irritants become enormous obstacles. This rage of emotion interferes with logical thought. NPCs who are angered have an unfriendly attitude. The best reaction such an NPC can have is indifferent. In addition, anger clouds judgment, imposing a -2 morale penalty to all skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.\n\n• Peace: The target feels a sense of calm and peace. While in this state, he is unable to initiate aggressive action. The attitude of an affected NPC will begin with indifferent, and any character who behaves positively toward the NPC receives a +5 bonus to determine the new attitude. However, while under the influence of the spell, the target is reluctant to attack anyone, even if defending herself. The target suffers a -2 morale penalty to attack and damage rolls while thus affected.\n\n• Hate: The target is filled with antipathy toward the world in general and anyone who dares cross his path. This consuming hatred can cloud his decision making ability. His initial NPC attitude toward others begins as unfriendly, and all attempts to influence him suffer a -5 penalty for the duration of the spell. In addition, hatred interferes with logical decision making, imposing a -2 morale penalty to all skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.\n\n• Love: Friendship and love dominate the mind of the target. While she will be more amenable and friendly, the love of others can interfere with daily decision making. The initial NPC attitude toward others begins as friendly, and any character who behaves in a positive manner receives a +5 bonus to reaction rolls. Those she considers friends are to be guarded and protected. If any attack her friends, the target receives a +3 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls to defend them. However, if those the target considers friends attack her, she gets a -2 morale penalty to attack and damage rolls against her friends.\n\nEmotions last as long as the caster can remain within earshot of the target and maintain her concentration. Once the casting ends, the spell effects remain for 1 round/level of spell caster.\n\nDecisions: If the cleric chooses to affect the target's decisions, he can alter what the target has already been thinking, but cannot plant completely new ideas in the target's mind. For example, if a kindly lord was considering trade negotiations with a neighboring city, the caster could guide the lord to accept or reject the offer. However, the target cannot be forced into doing something completely against her morals. In the example above, the caster could not cause the kindly lord to abandon all negotiations and kill the ambassadors.",

If used to aid a relatively straightforward act (swinging across a river on a vine, for example, as opposed to leaping to catch that vine to make the same swinging journey), its benefit decreases to a +3 luck bonus. Wild errantry also benefits actions of chance, such as rolling a particular result with dice (in game), finding something hidden (for example, under shells), or drawing a particular card. If a game of chance has been fixed to be impossible (a selection of cards has been altered, dice are \"crooked,\" or there's no hidden  marker under any shell), this magic tells its caster that.",

You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.",

This causes such creatures to seek to aid any obvious minions or worshipers of Hastur in sight, and any true worshiper of Hastur can command the affected creatures as if that worshiper had been the one to dominate them. In the case of conflicting commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must attempt opposed Charisma checks, with the winner being able to command the targets for that round. If no worshipers or agents of Hastur are in sight, an affected creature can act normally. When affected by this spell’s Yellow Sign in this way, the effects last for 1 round per level. Once triggered, the Yellow Sign remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.\n\nThere is a 1% chance when a creature fails its saving throw against this spell that Hastur takes note and, for reasons of his own, decides to control the target personally. In this case, the actions taken by the dominated creature are left to the GM to determine, but the effects of this spell’s Yellow Sign persist for 1 day per level and the commands issued cannot be countermanded by any other creature, even if they are Hastur worshipers.\n\nRegardless of how long the effects last or whether Hastur directly controls a victim, if a creature failed to resist this spell’s effects, Hastur can target that victim for the rest of its life with his fulvous dreams ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 140). Whether or not the Great Old One ever chooses to do so is left to the GM to determine.\n\nYellow Sign can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 18th level or higher for the cost of 40,000 gp.",
