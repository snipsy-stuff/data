### 📜 Description
A potent missile of positively or negatively charged energy (depending on which type you channel) darts from your fingertip, automatically striking its target. A positive energy bolt can heal living creatures or harm undead. A negative energy bolt harms living creatures and heals undead. Oracles who cast this spell must decide whether the bolt is made of positive or negative energy when it is cast.

The amount of damage dealt or healed is 1d6+1 hp/level. The power of the energy is so pure and powerful that it does not allow its target a saving throw.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Objects are not damaged by the spell.
