### 📜 Description
You tweak a strand of the subject's fate as they are making an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. The target receives a circumstance modifier of 1d20-10 to his or her check, which may be enough to retroactively turn a failure into a success (or vice versa). The target must take the modified result even if it's worse than the original.
