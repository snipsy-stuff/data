### 📜 Description
The target's scales become blindingly bright. Creatures within 30 ft. of the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become blinded. Every turn, a blinded creature may attempt a new saving throw to end the blindness effect. Creatures that recover from blindness in this way are not dazzled.

A successful initial save causes a creature to become dazzled for 1d4 rounds. When it would first be affected by this spell, a creature can instead choose to avert or close its eyes in the same way it would avoid a gaze attack.
