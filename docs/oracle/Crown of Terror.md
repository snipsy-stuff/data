### 📜 Description
You conjure a fiery halo that continually sends forth blood-red beams across the area around you. Whenever you charge, attack, or cast an offensive spell, opponents within 60 feet who witness the action become shaken (if they have the same or more Hit Dice than your caster level) or frightened (if they have fewer Hit Dice than your caster level).
