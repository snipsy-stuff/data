### 📜 Description
The caster's skin becomes mottled with violet, poisonfilled pustules. Any time the caster suffers physical damage (but not energy damage) there is a 50% chance that one or more of the pustules will rupture, spewing forth a poison. Anyone within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or be struck by the magically created poison. The save for the poison itself is a Fortitude save of the same DC as envenomed skin. Poison: contact; save DC of spell; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save. As a standard action, the caster can voluntarily rupture a pustule, which has the same effect. 

The effect of the spell incurs a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks, except that it confers a +2 circumstance bonus on all Disguise checks.
