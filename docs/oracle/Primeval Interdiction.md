### üìú Description
The cultists of Tanoth-Gha venerate a primordial being whose existence predates the rise of more modern religions, even those of civilizations now thought ancient. To those who worship in his name he therefore is able to grant the power to interrupt the flow of divine energies of beings less ancient than he. This spell can be used in three ways.

Area Interdiction: You can cut off an area from the power of other divinities, creating an emanation that interferes with the ability of creatures to cast divine spells, channel positive and negative energy (or use variant channeling effects), and activate supernatural or spell-like domain powers or other class abilities of divine spellcasting classes. A creature wishing to use such an ability must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 plus your caster level. This DC is increased by 1 for every 5 points of your Madness score (as above). If the check fails, the spell or ability is wasted without effect. It has no effect on magic items, except for spell-completion and spelltrigger items that create divine spells, in which case the item must make the caster level check. If this spell is cast on a permanent desecrated or unhallowed shrine or altar of Tanoth-Gha, the area of effect is increased to a 20-foot-radius spread.

Divine Dispelling: You can use primeval interdiction just as you would greater dispel magic, but it affects only divine spells and spell-like abilities. You can add 1 to your caster level checks to dispel for every 5 points of your Madness score.

Targeted Interdiction: You can bar a single creature from casting divine spells for 24 hours by making a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 plus the target‚Äôs caster level, with a +1 bonus to this check for every 5 points of your Madness score. If you succeed at this caster level check, the target cannot cast divine spells, prepare divine spells or spell slots, channel positive or negative energy (or an equivalent variant channeling ability), or to activate supernatural or spell-like domain abilities. Exceptional domain abilities and supernatural domain abilities that are constant in effect and do not require activation function normally. A successful Will save allows the target to continue to use these abilities, though the target‚Äôs effective divine class level is reduced by an amount equal to 1/3 your caster level for determining the effects of any divine spells or spell-like or supernatural abilities. It does not eliminate access to any abilities possessed by the target; it simply causes them to operate with reduced effect.

Divine spells with the mythos descriptor are unaffected by primordial interdiction.
