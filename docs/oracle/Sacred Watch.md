### 📜 Description
Sacred watch allows you to become instantly aware when the subject of this spell is in danger. Distance is not a factor and the spell even works across multiple planes and dimensions.

You receive a mental image of the subject, including the surrounding area when danger is present.

Note: This spell does not tell you where the subject is, only that the subject is in danger.
