### 📜 Description
This spell channels a small portion of a deity's divine essence, affecting all non-divine casters and nonworshipers of your deity within range, creating an awesome manifestation of the god that causes them to become dazed. All attacks by followers of your deity gain +4 sacred or profane damage bonus. A successful save negates the dazed effect but the target is still staggered for 1 round. The deity's presence cannot be dispelled, but the touch of a cleric of a different faith grants a second Will save that negates the spell's effects. This spell cannot be cast more than once per day.
