### 📜 Description
This spell temporarily grants the item your caster level, and the DC of one of its effects becomes 20+ your relevant caster ability modifier. It also adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don't know the item's abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, and if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activated as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item's normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires or it is discharged. Once the item has been used three times the spell is discharged. If the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.
