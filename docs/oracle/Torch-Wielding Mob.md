### 📜 Description
This spell functions as angry mob, but the mob brandishes flaring torches and its shouts are more fierce and disruptive. Any creature beginning its turn within the area catches on fire (Reflex negates) and is automatically dazzled for 1 round.

Unattended objects do not take fire damage from the torch-wielding mob. While standing within or adjacent to the torch-wielding mob, you gain a bonus to Intimidate checks equal to half your caster level (maximum +10).
