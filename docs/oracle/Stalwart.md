### 📜 Description
You bring a reeling, unconscious, exhausted, or sorely wounded creature back to full hp, fresh vigor, and inspired courage.

Application of this spell ends the blinded, confused, dazed, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, nauseated, sickened, and stunned conditions. It temporarily restores lost hp and suspends the effects of ability damage, disease, insanity, and poison. When stalwart expires, suspended conditions return, and the spell recipient ends up 1 hp better than they were when this spell was applied to them, unless they were already at full hp. You may only cast this spell on yourself once per day, but you may cast it an unlimited number of times on other creatures.

When stalwart is applied to an undead creature, it deals 1 hp damage per level every round, and it temporarily restores the mind of the undead to the alignment, views, knowledge, and attitude it had before death. If stalwart magic (one spell or multiple stalwarts, in combination) reduces an undead to negative hp before spell expiration, the undead is destroyed. If not, it returns to 1 hp less than it had when the spell affected it.
