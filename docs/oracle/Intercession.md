### üìú Description
With intercession, you can sacrifice yourself to protect another from a harmful event. Once the spell is cast, during the duration, you may take a move action to place yourself adjacent to or in the same square as another creature within range of your movement. (This creature cannot be an enemy.) You provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement. When you arrive, you may place yourself in the path and become the target of one attack, spell, or other harmful effect that was going to affect your ally. You suffer the consequences of this attack as if you were the initial target instead of the other creature. The creature you are protecting completely avoids all effects of the attack. This discharges the intercession spell. 

You may intercede at any point during the attack, but cannot intercede once the attacker's turn is over. For example, you could intercede before the target rolled a saving throw, after the saving throw and before damage was rolled, or after damage was rolled and before the attacker finished his actions for the turn. However, once the attack is complete and the target has suffered the effects, the opportunity for intercession is over. 

Multiple attacks from the same creature in a single round (such as iterative attacks from a weapon, several magic missiles from a single spell, or multiple eye rays from a many-eyed creature) count as one attack for the purpose of this spell. If you intercede against one of them, you intercede against them all. 

Special movement-based abilities such as evasion that allow you to avoid damage from certain attacks cannot prevent you from taking damage from the attack, since you are deliberately putting yourself in harm's way to save another. You may still roll a saving throw as normal (if the attack allows it). 

If you are incorporeal, gaseous, or otherwise physically unable to prevent an attack from reaching the creature (including being paralyzed, ethereal, and so on), the intercession has no effect and is discharged. 

You can have only one intercession active at one time.
