### 📜 Description
You are able to impart a curse on an object. This causes the object to function exactly the opposite of how it was meant to work. Thus, a +3 sword becomes a -3 sword, a ring of fire resistance 10 causes its wielder to take 10 more points of damage from fire sources, etc. If the object is unattended, it receives no save. If attended, it uses the wielder's saves. If unattended at the time of the curse, the object functions as a normal cursed item when picked up by a character.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
