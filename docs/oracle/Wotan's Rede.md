### 📜 Description
You recite a poem that is sent to your lips by the ancient gods of knowledge and wisdom. It grants you supernatural insight or advice.

As a result, you may make one Knowledge (geography, history, local, nature, or nobility) or Perform (oratory) check with an insight bonus equal to your level. You may make this check even if you are untrained in the skill. If you are trained in the skill, your normal bonus stacks with the insight bonus this spell provides.

If you choose not to use this spell in place of a skill check, it insteads provides a piece of general advice that's equivalent to one from an augury or divination spell. This spell may not be used with the Silent Spell feat.
