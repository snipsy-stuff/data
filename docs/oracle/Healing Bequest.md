### 📜 Description
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 hp +1 hp per level (maximum +5). The target gains the ability to touch another valid target and heal it a like manner, and by doing so transfers the ability to heal by touch to the next target. This creates a chain of healing that can continue each round that the spell lasts. Only one living creature may be cured by the spell each round, and the same creature cannot be affected by the same casting of healing bequest more than once. The target does not have to touch another target on its next turn for the spell to remain active; however, this counts as 1 round of the spell duration.

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell damages them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and it can attempt a Will save for half damage. Using the spell this way ends the spell-an undead cannot pass on a healing bequest by touch.
