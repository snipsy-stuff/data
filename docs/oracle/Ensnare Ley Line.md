### 📜 Description
You harness the eldritch energy that naturally flows through you and funnel it toward a nearby ley line, temporarily warping it to your advantage.

When casting this spell, make a level check (DC 18) to determine whether the spell ensnares the ley line. For each caster that has successfully used the ley line during the encounter, increase the level check's DC by 1.

Upon a successful check, whenever you successfully use that ley line you may either choose the desired effect from the appropriate ley line effects table or you may choose to roll on a table one step higher (If you do the latter, roll normally).

If the ley line you ensnare is locked, you may either use its effect or roll on a table one step higher. If you do, add or subtract 1 to your roll's result if desired.

This spell does not affect the negative effects incurred during ley line burnout or when rolling a natural 1 on a level check to use the ley line.
