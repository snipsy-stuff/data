### 📜 Description
This spell renders you effectively immortal while your nemesis is also alive. So long as you keep a personal item belonging to your archenemy (what constitutes an archenemy is subject to GM adjudication) and that archenemy is alive, any effect that would result in your death or destruction is negated by this powerful abjuration. You cannot die so long as your archenemy is alive. 

Remove curse does not negate this spell and it cannot be dispelled. However, if your archenemy's personal item is removed from the box you can be slain or destroyed (often this box is hidden away and well protected). You also lose the benefits of this spell if your archenemy dies or is destroyed. If you archenemy is dead you are subject to a soul bind effect with the spell focus of this spell serving as the spell focus.
