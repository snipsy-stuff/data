### üìú Description
A hazy, strong-smelling cloud billows out from the point you designate. Though the cloud is dense enough to be visible, it is thin enough to allow normal vision within. The incense haze confers its effects on anyone within the cloud, and those effects persist as long as the individuals remain within the cloud. If the cloud moves away or individuals leave the cloud's area, the effects end for those individuals.

The cloud can move 30 ft. per round if you actively direct it (a move action for you). If you do not actively direct it, the cloud stays at rest. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.

You choose the effect the cloud produces when you cast the spell. The possible effects are:

Embalming Incense: Those within the cloud gain a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.

Incense of Focused Physicality: Those within the cloud gain a +2 sacred bonus to attack rolls.

Incense of Sweetness: The cloud suppresses any nausea or sickness effects on those within its area, and they gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves. Any suppressed nausea or sickness effects return with the same duration as before once the cloud dissipates.

Incense of the Practiced Mind: Those in the cloud gain a +4 bonus to concentration checks and +2 to level checks made to penetrate spell resistance.
