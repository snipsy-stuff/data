### 📜 Description
You place an especially powerful curse on the creature touched, choosing one of the following effects:

• The targets ability score becomes 1. • Target always fails saving throws and skill checks. • Target always fails attack rolls and ability checks. • Target's age increases to its maximum age minus one year. (Take the venerable age for the target's race, then roll as normal for maximum age and subtract 1 from the result. Dragons are immune to this effect.) • All magic items in the target's possession become nonmagical as if they were within an antimagic field.

You may also invent your own malediction, but it should be no more powerful than those listed above. The GM has final say on the curse's effect.

The malediction bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled but can be removed by a miracle or wish spell.
