### 📜 Description
Upon completing this spell, you are filled with a desire to overrun and trample your foes. You immediately move up to twice your speed in a straight line, trampling every foe in your path. During this movement, you can overrun any creature equal to your size or smaller. This works like the combat maneuver, but you do not need to make the check. You simply move through foes. Trampling a foe deals 1d6 hp damage plus 1-1/2 your Strength modifier (1d8 if you are Large).

If you possess hooves, you add twice your Strength modifier to the damage instead. Targets you overrun can take an attack of opportunity against you, but at a -4 penalty. Targets that forego their attack of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to halve the damage (DC as for this spell).
