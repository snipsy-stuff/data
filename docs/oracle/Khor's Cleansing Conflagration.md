### 📜 Description
You create greenish-orange flames that burn in the area you designate; they burn undead, aberrations, and evil outsiders while leaving other creatures mostly unharmed.

The magical flames inflict 1d12 hp fire damage for every 2 levels you possess. Creatures of the affected types that are caught in the flames or move into the affected area receive a save against the damage each round they are in the area of effect. Creatures in the area when the flames first ignite must make a Will save or attempt to flee the area for 1 round.

Creatures of other types that are caught in or enter the area must also make a Fort save, but they suffer no damage on a successful save and 1 hp fire damage on a failed save.

Khor's cleansing conflagration cannot be doused by mundane or magical water, but it can be doused by dispel magic and other such spells.
