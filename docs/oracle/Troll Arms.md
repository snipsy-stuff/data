### 📜 Description
The subject of this spell gains the long, lanky, powerful arms of a troll. The target creature must have arms or arm-like appendages or the spell has no effect. The subject gains a +2 inherent bonus to Strength and its natural reach increases by 5 feet. The subject also gains two natural claw attacks with which it is automatically proficient. The claws deal damage appropriate for the creature's size (1d6 for a Medium sized creature) plus the subject's Strength modifier.
