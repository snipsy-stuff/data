### 📜 Description
This spell causes the target creature touched to gain the fatigued condition. The target gains a new saving throw at a -1 penalty after one minute. The target gains a second save at a -2 penalty the next minute, and this repeats until he makes his save or the fatigue condition is removed by adequate sleep.
