### 📜 Description
With this prayer you provide long-lasting succor to a wounded creature. For as long as the effect lasts, the target receives a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects. At any time while the spell is in effect, the target can choose to end the spell as a swift action for a burst of healing energy. The target loses the saving throw bonus, but is healed of 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).
