### 📜 Description
You channel the power of your god to suppress magic from divine sources (other than you) in the area. All creatures that fail their saving throw temporarily lose access to all spells derived from a divine source if that source is other than your god. This access is lost for as long as they remain in the area of the spell. This spell has no effect on deities or artifacts.
