### 📜 Description
You create a zone of good luck around the target creature; he always knows where to step to avoid a trap, when to duck to miss an attack, and how to parry the swiftest of blows. As a result, the creature enjoys a +5 luck bonus to Armor Class, CMD, and all saving throws for the duration of the spell. The Armor Class bonus applies even when the target is flat-footed or subject to touch attacks. 

Unlike mundane armor, fortune's armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since fortune's armor is a property of good luck and timing, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
