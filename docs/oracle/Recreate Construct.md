### 📜 Description
You restore a destroyed construct to 1 hit point (plus its bonus hit points), and bring it under your control. You can recreate a construct that has been destroyed for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, if the construct was intelligent then the subject's spirit must be free and willing to return. If the subject's spirit is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. You cannot control multiple constructs with this spell unless you created them, if you cast it again you lose control of the previous construct (the one you did not create). 

Being recreated lessens the structural integrity of any construct. The subject of the spell loses 1 HD when it is recreated. If the subject is 1 HD, it cannot be recreated. This HD loss cannot be repaired by any means. A construct with spellcasting ability that was destroyed loses all spell slots and prepared spells upon being recreated and cannot use spell-like or supernatural abilities for 24 hours. 

No curses affecting the construct are undone by this spell. While the spell repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the construct to be recreated must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is recreated. Only equipment that is part of the construct is repaired by this spell.
