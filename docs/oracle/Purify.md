### 📜 Description
This spell releases a burst of pure, life-granting energy from the positive energy plane. All land in the area of effect becomes permanently pristine and beautiful. 

The spell causes all plants to reach their mature growth immediately. 

Against undead creatures, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum of 20d6). Purify is equally effective against other opponents. Against non-undead, evil-aligned creatures, the spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum of 10d8). Undead destroyed by this blast are returned to life as if by a resurrection spell 1d4 rounds later if a resurrection spell cast by you could affect them. 

All food and water in the area is affected as if a purify food and drink had been cast upon it, conjuration (healing) spells cast in the area affected by purify are cast at +1 caster level and the DCs to save against their effects are at +1. A wish or miracle spell is needed to harm the land affected by this spell. 

Good-aligned living creatures caught in the purify spell's burst heal all damage as if affected by a heal spell and gain temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 25).
