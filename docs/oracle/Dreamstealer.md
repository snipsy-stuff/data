### üìú Description
By means of this powerful spell the caster curses his victim with eternal nights of fitful, dreamless sleep that can induce a crippling state of hopelessness. The victim can be any distance away upon the same plane of existence. In addition to the complicated ritual needed to cast this spell, the caster must also have some personal belonging of the victim or some part of the victim's body (lock of hair, a drop of blood, nail shaving, etc.) The victim's belonging or body part must be sealed in the specially built ivory box. The next time the subject sleeps, his dreams will be stolen, leaving behind an empty, disturbing void save for an image of the caster (or of a faceless individual if the caster wishes to remain anonymous) placing the victim's personal belonging in the ivory box. When the victim awakes he suffers a -1 profane penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, checks, and weapon damage rolls, this penalty increases by one for each dreamless night the subject endures (maximum -25 profane penalty). 

This spell cannot be dispelled; only destroying the ivory box, a miracle or a carefully worded wish ends this spell. Creatures that do not sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell.
