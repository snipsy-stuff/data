### 📜 Description
This powerful spell creates a direct channel between you and your deity or ethos, giving you a surge of divine power. You gain a +8 enhancement bonus to a single ability score (which should depend on the god selected), a +6 enhancement bonus to other abilities, a +2 deflection bonus to your Armor Class, and damage reduction 10/-.

Once the effect of the deity's form has worn off, you must make a Fortitude save (DC equal to the spell with the spell's modified ability score) or be exhausted.
