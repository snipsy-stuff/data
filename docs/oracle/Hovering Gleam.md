### 📜 Description
You create a floating sphere of white light that emits brightness equal to that of a candle.  The 5 ft. surrounding the nub is increased in illumination by one step (from darkness to dim light, for example). You can move this sphere as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like.

The sphere can move up to 100 ft. per round. The sphere winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.

You can only have one hovering gleam spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent, it does not count against this limit.

Hovering gleam can be made permanent with a permanency spell at a cost of 2,500 gp.
