### 📜 Description
Upon casting this spell, you receive a surge of divine energy that grants you a +1 competence bonus on any one attack roll, saving throw, or check you make in the next minute. You must decide if you will use the bonus before you make the die roll. For every 4 caster levels beyond 1st, you get an extra +1 bonus (+2 at 5th level, etc.) to a maximum of +5 at 17th level.
