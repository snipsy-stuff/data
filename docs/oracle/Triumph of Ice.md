### üìú Description
You transform one of the five natural elements (air/fog, water, earth, fire, or lava) into ice or snow. The effect varies depending on the element targeted, as listed below. All damage is limited to 20 dice.

Air/Fog: Vapors condense into snow. If cast upon a fog cloud, stinking cloud or a similar effect this spell either suppresses that effect for 1 round per level or adds freezing fog to its other effects (your choice). Creatures with the air subtype take 1d6 hp damage per level and, if airborne, must make a Fly check (DC equal to the spell's save) or crash.

Water: Water becomes a sheet of ice up to one inch thick per level. Creatures in the targeted area must make a Reflex save to avoid being caught and immobilized. Escape requires a successful Strength or Escape Artist check against the spell's save DC. Affected creatures with the water subtype take no damage but are paralyzed for 1 round per level if they fail a Fortitude save. If successful, they are slowed for 1 round per level if they pass.

Earth: You transform earth into permafrost, ending the duration of rock to mud or creating an effect similar to mud to rock. Creatures burrowing through the area do so at half their normal speed until the area thaws. If they can burrow through solid rock, their speed is unaffected.

Affected creatures with the earth subtype take 1d4 hp damage per level because this spell generates stress fractures that riddle their bodies.

Fire: Fire is transformed into shards of ice, which function as caltrops if walked over. The ice melts normally and does not reignite unless it is part of the area of effect of an ongoing spell or similar effect. If that is the case, the flames return after 1 round per level.

Affected creatures with the fire subtype take 1d8 hp damage per level. They also are stunned for 1d3 rounds unless they make a successful Fortitude save.

Lava: Lava is cooled and forms a stone crust up to one inch thick per every 2 levels. Exceptionally heavy weights may cause the crust to break (see rules for crossing ice in chapter five of Northlands).

Affected elemental creatures suffer damage or other negative effects depending on their subtype. Treat a creature with the water subtype as if the lava were water, a creature with the earth subtype as if the lava were earth, and so on. Creatures may be entitled to a Fortitude save for half damage or to limit or negate other effects, as listed above.
