### 📜 Description
You summon a star from the heavens to do your bidding. It appears as a glowing humanoid with long white hair, birdlike talons as well as hands, and it carries a staff made of pure force. All creatures other than you who view the star must make a DC 20 Will save or be fascinated for the duration of the spell. The star is otherwise equivalent to an avoral agathion (Bestiary 2) with 91 hp whose lightning bolt ability deals force damage.
