### 📜 Description
This spell permanently fouls a small cistern or any single source of fresh water no larger than a small stream or spring. It has no effect on salt water, on larger sources of water, or on other liquid of any sort. A spring or stream polluted by the spell will eventually cleanse itself in 1d4 weeks. Any creature that drinks from the fouled water source must immediately make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to spell's DC) or contract blinding sickness (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game).

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled or removed by a remove curse spell, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, commune with nature, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell.
