### 📜 Description
You create an amorphous, diamond-shaped cloud of clashing, flashing miniature swords, which clang and snarl savagely against each other. These blades are composed of force, not metal, and their shield-like clump they form hovers or flies about, always moving so as to remain adjacent to the target you choose when the spell is cast (the target cannot change once the spell is cast).

Snarling steel can be used against any one opponent, regardless of what they are attacking, to parry that opponent's physical attacks (forcing such attacks to hit take a 2d4 penalty). Snarling steel has no effect on magic item discharges or spells.

Alternatively, you can assign the snarling steel to move with and protect yourself or one target (who need not be touched, aware of this protection, or even willing to be protected). The cloud of swords automatically intercepts and deflects all missile attacks and hurled things. A snarling steel can deflect large and heavy objects dropped or falling from above, but if it successfully turns aside something as heavy as or heavier than its caster, its magic is exhausted and the spell ends.
