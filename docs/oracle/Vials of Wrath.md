### üìú Description
You utter seven words and each time you do, you pluck a magically-created vial from your tongue and set it before you. The vials tremble with scarcely contained power. This spell creates up to seven vials, one per round of the spell's duration.

When a vial is created, you may cause its effect to take place immediately at any point within the spell's range, or you can keep it for later use. Should you not use the vial immediately, it remains potent for 10 minutes per level. To use a saved vial, you must shatter it in the area to be affected (you need not be the one to shatter the vial). Vials weigh 1 ounce apiece and can be thrown as grenade-like weapons with a 10- foot range increment. The effects of the vials can be dispelled as normal depending on the nature of the effect's duration (permanent, instantaneous, or a given duration). 

The vials appear, one per round of concentration, in the following order:

Round    Vial Effect 1              Creatures within a 50-ft.-radius spread take 8d6 points of unholy damage (no save) and are scarred by a mark of your choosing. This mark can be no more than 4 inches in diameter. It can be removed only with a regeneration, miracle or wish. This is an instantaneous effect.

2                Water within a 150-ft.-radius spread is transformed into blood (no save). Any water-breathing creature within the area of effect must hold its breath until it escapes the area or drown. In a large body of water or running water, the blood dissipates naturally. This is an instantaneous effect.

3                 All non-water liquids within a 150-ft.- radius spread, even potions, turn to blood. Magical liquids or creatures carrying them can make a Will save against this effect, one for each liquid. This is an instantaneous effect.

4                Creatures within a 50-ft.-radius spread explode into flames, taking 8d6 points of fire damage (no save). This is an instantaneous effect.

5                Creatures within a 50-ft.-radius spread are blinded, taking 1 point of Dexterity damage each round. A Will save negates the Dexterity damage each round. This is a permanent effect.

6                Appearing in the vial's space, 1d3 swarms as per the creeping doom spell.

7                As symbol of death in a 150-ft.-radius area.
