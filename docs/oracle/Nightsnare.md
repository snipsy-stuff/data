### 📜 Description
You spin a web of pale, dreamy light, causing a comatose slumber to come upon the target (which may include causing the subject to fall prone, any damage from which does not awaken the victim). A victim of nightsnare is helpless. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new save to end the effect. Slapping or wounding the target rouses the individual immediately, but normal noise does not. Rousing a sleeper with slaps or wounds requires an attack action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The sleeper rouses automatically when the duration of nightsnare ends.
