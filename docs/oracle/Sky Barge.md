### 📜 Description
This powerful spell creates an ornate barge of fine quality, similar in appearance to those great vessels some sun deities have been depicted of using to sail daily across the sky. This barge, too, is capable of flight, and is useful for high-level spellcasters to transport themselves, their companions, and any mounts or cargo for long distances. The barge can carry up to 400 pounds of weight per caster level. It flies at a rate of 5 feet per caster level, or twice that if the caster has at least six people manning the oars. Manning an oar is considered the equivalent of hustling, and characters will have to trade off and rest between sessions to keep the barge moving at full speed. When the spell duration ends, the barge instantly comes to a stop and drifts down to the ground. It vanishes upon contact with the earth (or water, or other surface), possibly leaving the passengers and cargo scattered. If the caster deliberately lands the barge before the duration expires, however, the barge does not vanish, and it can be unloaded in an orderly fashion, and it may lift off once again.
