### 📜 Description
You give a rousing speech for 10 minutes while you cast this spell. Upon finishing, all allies within the area of effect who heard your speech gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Additionally, each recipient benefits from the Diehard feat while bolstered by this spell. Finally, each ally affected by this spell gains the effects of status with respect to you.

If you move farther away than 1 mile from your allies or you die, this spell ends. A character may only be affected by one inspiring speech at a time; any subsequent castings automatically fail.
