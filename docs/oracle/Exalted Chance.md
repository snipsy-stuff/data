### üìú Description
You gain a divine blessing for one action of any type. You may choose the specific action affected at any time while the exalted chance is active.

You feel an inner tingling while the spell is active. It becomes a rising, rushing sound ending in a trumpet-like blare (that is audible to you and others) when you call on the exalted chance. If the spell's benefit is not used before the spell duration expires, it simply fades away without effect.

Once you choose the affected action, this spell allows five rolls to be made for it. You take the most favorable result. This magic can affect only actions you (the caster) take or attempts you make (such as aiding another). You can choose, during or after casting, to transfer the benefits of the spell to a willing creature you touch. If you do, the target chooses when to call on the exalted chance and gains three rolls, choosing the most favorable one.
