### 📜 Description
You transfer your essence into a single non-intelligent construct over which you have control that is on the same plane as you. This act disintegrates your previous body. You now possess the construct's body with all of its physical properties as per the magic jar spell. You lose all benefits of certain abilities if the construct's body does not meet the prerequisites for them (for example the Dodge feat requires a Dexterity of 13). You suffer the loss of four character levels due to the stress of the transformation; these cannot be regained except by normal advancement. If the construct possesses magic immunity you lose an additional level. Unlike normal constructs, you are not immune to mind-affecting spells or effects. You are also not immune to all necromantic spells and effects. Spells that rely on the existence of a creature's soul, but not "life force," namely astral projection, clone, magic jar, and soul bind, can affect you, but you are still immune to death effects. You cannot be raised or resurrected, even by miracle, wish or true resurrection. If you possess the magic immunity special ability these spells now ignore that ability.
