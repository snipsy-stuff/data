### 📜 Description
Evulsion violently extracts a creature's skeleton, causing 2d6 hp slashing damage per level (maximum 40d6 at 20th level) and the target creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage. Exoskeletal creatures take a -4 penalty to this Fortitude save. Creatures without a skeleton, such as oozes and constructs, are unaffected by evulsion.

A body of a creature killed by evulsion is not intact enough to be returned to life by a raise dead spell, although reincarnate, resurrection, miracle, or wish will bring back the creature.
