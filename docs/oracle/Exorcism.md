### 📜 Description
This spell expels a possessing entity (such as a ghost, demon, or wizard using magic jar) from its victim. Add the possessing creature's HD to its saving throw and subtract the caster's character level as well. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly expelled from the possessed victim. Since the expelled creature is free to act on its next turn, the exorcism spell is often used in conjunction with protection from evilto prevent the creature from possessing the victim (or the priest) again. The spell focus used is any item that is distasteful to the target. For each such object or substance, the character gains +1 on the character's caster level check to overcome the target's SR (if any) and +2 on the saving throw DC. At the DM's option, certain rare items or true names might work more powerfully (each providing +2 against SR and +4 on the spell's DC).
