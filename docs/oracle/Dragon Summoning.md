### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, you summon an adult dragon of the same type as the dragon scale you used in the casting. The moment the casting is complete, a lone dragon appears high in the sky above you. It is not under your direct control, but it will accept your commands and aid you to the best of its abilities for the spell's duration. Regardless of the commands you give it, the dragon will not deliberately injure itself or engage in combat with opponents whose Challenge Rating exceeds its own by 8 or more. You may dismiss the dragon from serving you at any time, but it then becomes free to stay or depart, as it desires; you may then find that you must negotiate for its services or forbearance, requiring more than the initial tribute offered during casting. If you fail to reach an agreement with the dragon, you may well face its wrath (often it will simply wait and return when you are in a weakened state).
