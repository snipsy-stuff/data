### 📜 Description
This spell subtly disables a quadruped (such as a horse, cow, or other four-legged animal) such that it can no longer move at its normal speed without incurring injury. An affected creature that moves more than half its base speed takes 1d6 hp damage. The creature's rider or someone tending the creature notices the damage with a DC 15 Heal or DC 20 Perception check.

Addition from Hobble Mount: Rider possibly thrown, affects multiple creatures.
