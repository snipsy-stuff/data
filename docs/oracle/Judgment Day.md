### 📜 Description
The subject's deeds are judged by the power of law. The subject is investigated regarding the following actions he may have taken: unprovoked violence or murder; broken a truce, peace treaty, or violated the territorial sovereignty of another state; looted recently (within 1 week) wrecked ships and persons thereon; committed piracy (privateers are exempt); mistreated prisoners; violated the sovereignty of foreign embassies or harmed a known diplomat; failed to properly execute a legal extradition of a prisoner; owned slaves or worked as a slave trader (enslavement of those defeated in a declared war, to avoid genocide is permissible); and, finally, assisted in the crime of genocide against any race, ethnic group or culture. If the subject has committed any of the preceding acts, the subject loses all perception of realty and constantly relives the perpetrated acts as if he were the victim of the offense, rendering him blind and deaf and losing access to all other senses (blindsight, tremorsense, etc.). The subject also suffers an insight penalty to his attack rolls, checks, and saving throws equal to your caster level. A successful save negates the blindness, deafness, loss of senses, and reduces the insight penalty to -2.
