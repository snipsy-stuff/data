### 📜 Description
You grant the bane special ability to one melee weapon or up to six projectiles (as in arrows, bolts, or other ammunition) for the spell's duration. The type of creature targeted (such as dragons, undead, and so on) must be chosen at the time of casting. While the spell lasts, the affected weapon is a bane weapon, with a +2 bonus against designated foes and the ability to deal an extra 2d6 hp damage.
