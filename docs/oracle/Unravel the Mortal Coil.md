### 📜 Description
You can attempt to slay any one living creature and animate it. When you cast this spell, your hand seethes with eerie bright emerald fire. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the target. The target takes 12d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level; if the target is slain it gains the corporeal undead simple template (see below) and is under your control as per animate dead. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw and still become the caster's undead servant. If you create a second undead servant with this spell, the other servant becomes either free willed upon a successful Will saving throw (same DC as the spell) or becomes a normal corpse.
