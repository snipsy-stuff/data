### 📜 Description
Kismet creates a mystic connection between you and the spell's subjects so that they feel your pain. You still take damage normally, but while this spell is active any damage you are dealt is dealt to the spell's subjects as well. Only hit point damage and ability damage are transferred in this way, and target creatures are not subject to any additional effects that might accompany a damage-dealing attack (such as poison or energy drain).

You can intentionally target yourself with an attack (magical or otherwise) in order to deal damage to the targets. However, whenever you are subjected to damage that allows a saving throw, you must attempt your saving throw before the damage is passed to the spell's subjects. You are not allowed to voluntarily fail your saving throw or lower your spell resistance against any damage-dealing effects while kismet is active.

If all of the spell's subjects are slain by transferred damage, the spell ends. If a spellcaster casts kismet on another spellcaster who has kismet already active, both spells end immediately and both casters take 3d6 points of damage from magical feedback.
