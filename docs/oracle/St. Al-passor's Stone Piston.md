### 📜 Description
Your upthrust arms cause a massive column stone to jut up from the floor with tremendous force and speed. The column's height can be up to 5 ft. per your level and its diameter can be up to 5 ft. per every five levels you possess.

All creatures and objects in the area of effect that fail a Reflex save are smashed against the ceiling, take 1d6 hp bludgeoning damage per level (maximum 10d6 hp damage) and must succeed on a second Reflex save or gain the pinned condition until they escape or the spell ends. The column's CMD, for the purposes of escaping the pin, is equal to 16 + caster's BAB. If the conjured column does not reach the ceiling, those who fail their save are carried aloft to the full height of the column. Whether crushed or carried, those atop the column are subject to falling damage (1d6hp damage/10 ft. of the column's height) when the spell ends.

Conjured columns can be made permanent with the permanency spell. The legendary master of this spell, Al-Passor, patron saint of the Andarrean stone whisperers, created impossibly tall columns that still wall off the Gardens of Carnessa peninsula and protect the Haunted Land of the Giants from the sentient plants of the jungle beyond.
