### 📜 Description
This spell causes the target creature to vomit forth bizarre objects. On the first round and every 1d4 rounds after that, the subject must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated and spew forth a magically conjured bizarre object (a couch, a dead bull, an anvil, a wagon wheel, etc.) of the caster's choice into a random adjacent square, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level divided between the subject and the creatures in the affected square. Creatures that possess damage reduction 5 or greater that is not overcome by bludgeoning damage are immune to this spell and its effects. In addition, all creatures in other adjacent squares take 1 point of splash damage per caster levels as the object shatters on impact and then disappears. A successful save negates the nauseated condition and the spewing until the spell triggers again. The objects that are spewed forth possess no special properties.
