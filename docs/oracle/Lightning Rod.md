### üìú Description
You become a living lightning rod. You are immune to electricity as if you were the recipient of protection from energy (with which this spell does not stack or overlap). You can absorb 12 hp electricity damage per level (maximum 180 hp at 15th level).

Additionally, all magical electricity ranged attacks (such as lightning bolt, chain lightning, or dragons' electrical breath weapons) that originate within or pass through the area of effect are drawn to you, as if you had been the target. If you are outside the range of the attack, the attack is still drawn toward you, but it does not reach you. Any other creatures between you and the source of the attack are targeted or affected as normal by the attack.

While this spell lasts, you do not get a Reflex save against any electricity attacks, nor do you benefit from evasion or improved evasion against these attacks. Lightning rod overlaps (but does not stack with) resist energy.

If the spell absorbs the full amount of electrical damage (according to your level), it is discharged, you take any remaining damage from that attack, and the area effect ends. If the spell is dismissed, all its effects end.
