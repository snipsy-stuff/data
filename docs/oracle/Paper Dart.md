### 📜 Description
Paper dart allows you to collect information about nearby creatures. The thrown dart spirals outwards from you, circling the area out to the maximum range, before returning to you at the end of the spell. When unfolded, the dart lists all creatures with Intelligence greater than 3 that it sensed along its way. The dart detects all creatures in the area during the spell's duration, even through buildings and the ground, though lead sheeting or magical protection blocks this detection. The information on the unfolded dart only lasts one hour, after which the dart crumbles away.
