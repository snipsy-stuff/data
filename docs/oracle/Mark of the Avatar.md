### üìú Description
The energy of this spell creates a mark on the face, hand, or other prominent feature of any living creature representative of the deity or power invoked by the caster. 

Taking avatar form is an immediate action and the avatar form lasts for 1 minute per caster level; transforming to or from avatar form requires the command word to be spoken, so that a gag or a silence effect can prevent it from occurring. The transformation is always a spectacular affair; the subject appears to be struck by lightning, or engulfed in flames, or glow with otherworldly energy. The display is sufficient to immediately ruin any attempt to hide, and grants a +10 circumstance bonus to the Perception checks of anyone who simply hasn't noticed the subject's presence. 

The avatar looks only slightly like the subject's normal form. It is always in the prime of life, even if the subject is younger or older, and is obviously virile and powerful. The avatar displays an obvious magical nature, the exact details of which depend on the deity or power that created the avatar; the subject may crackle with an aura of electricity, or have eyes of flame and skin of steel, or any other mystic appearance (subject to GM approval). The avatar is different enough from the subject's normal countenance that it counts as a disguise, even granting a +10 circumstance bonus to the Disguise skill check if someone might recognize him.

The subject is healed as by a heal spell and gains darkvision out to 60 feet. The subject also gain a +10 size bonus to Strength, a +8 size bonus to Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, and gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to the spellcaster's caster level. 

For the duration of the effect, while in avatar form, damage the avatar form takes is treated as if it were dealt to a different character and is taken from this separate set of hit points, rather than the caster's own hit points, as are all effects up to and including death (which ends the spell, returning the subject to its original form, in the same location where the avatar was slain). If the avatar is reduced to negative hit points or is slain, the subject immediately reverts to normal form. All equipment carried by the caster changes appearance slightly to match the avatar's overall image (and new size, if the avatar form is larger or smaller), but is otherwise unaffected. 

The avatar is immune to ability drain, ability damage, disease, energy drain, poison, and polymorph; any of these effects that have taken hold on the subject are suppressed while in avatar form. Any other spell or ability affecting the subject also affects the avatar when it is taken. An anti-magic field suppresses the avatar form as long as the subject remains within, but the avatar form returns if the caster leaves the area (it does not count against the duration of the effect). 

At the end of this effect's duration, the subject reverts back to his normal shape, and is fatigued for an amount of time equal to the length of time he held avatar form. The subject can also return to normal form voluntarily, which will naturally shorten the duration of his fatigue. 

You can only be subject to one mark of the avatar at a time, and you cannot cast this spell gain until the spell has discharged and the duration of the avatar form is expired, If the avatar form is slain, the caster can never again cast this spell, as if it was not part of his spell list.
