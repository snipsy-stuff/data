### 📜 Description
Light winds encircle you, leaving you in the center of a mild vortex. You receive a +2 deflection bonus to AC against ranged attacks. You also receive a +4 bonus on saves against very hot conditions, including the negative impacts of mundane heat (see the Environment portion of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), and saves against cloud vapors and gases (such as cloudkill, stinking cloud, and inhaled poisons). This spell does not function without air or underwater.
