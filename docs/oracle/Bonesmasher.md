### 📜 Description
This spell creates a jarring resonance in the bones of any creature in the area. Against skeletons, liches, or other creatures made up primarily of bone, this spell deals 1d6 hp sonic damage per caster level, maximum 5d6. Such creatures can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. Against living creatures with a skeletal structure, this spell leaves them staggered for one round. Living creatures affected by this spell can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect.
