### 📜 Description
If your body (or that of a touched creature) is planted on solid ground or the floor, you resist being hurled back by any charging or impaling attack, resist melee damage, and improve your defenses. For 3 rounds, this magic prevents the body from being moved (unless you or the spell's recipient desire to move), and it absorbs up to 77 hp of melee damage (if more damage is sustained, this spell automatically ends).

The spell provides a +3 sacred bonus to AC, and it bolsters the joints of the body, so you can withstand the impact of even a team of galloping horses or oxen crashing into you. At the end of this spell, the affected creature is fatigued.

This spell is often used to allow a single shieldmaiden to temporarily hold a bridge, doorway, or another choke point against a mighty onslaught as a delaying action.
