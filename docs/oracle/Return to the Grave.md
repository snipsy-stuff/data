### 📜 Description
You place a curse upon a creature that banishes and bars a returned spirit from beyond the grave. If the creature has been returned to life after death (raise dead, resurrection, true resurrection) or been transformed into an undead creature, that creature immediately starts traveling toward its sacred resting place (tomb, grave, pyre) at its best possible speed. If such a site does not exist, it returns to the location of its death. Once it arrives it dies or is transformed back into a dead creature. Anyone casting a spell that would communicate with the now dead creature, return it to life, or turn it into an undead creature must succeed on a caster level check with a DC of 11 plus your caster level. 

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, wish, or miracle. Remove curse only grants the victim a second saving throw; if this second save is failed, the spell has no further effect.
