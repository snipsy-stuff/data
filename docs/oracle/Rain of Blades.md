### 📜 Description
You call down a rain of swords, spears, and axes, thrown down by the sacred dead of the gods of war. The blades cause 1d10 hp damage per 2 levels (maximum 10d10). Any intelligent undead injured automatically become shaken for 5d6 rounds with no save.

The blades land in such profusion that any square targeted counts as a low obstacle for the spell's duration. About half of the blades gain the broken condition upon landing, but the rest may be seized and used by combatants as normal. The quality of weapon appearing varies depending on the caster's level:

7th Level: Normal quality.
 11th Level: Masterwork quality.
 15th Level: Magical weapons with +1 enhancement bonuses on each.

If the caster is 15th level or higher, the spell's damage increases by 1 hp per die rolled.

When the spell ends, roars of laughter fill the air and all the weapons disappear.
