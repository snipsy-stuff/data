### 📜 Description
This spell surrounds your head with a nimbus of golden light. The halo gives off light equivalent to a continual flame spell, and temporarily represses any darkness effect, even those of higher level, within the radius of its own light.

While the halo is in effect, you gain fast healing 1. This ability increases by 1 for every three additional levels above 7th (fast healing 2 at 10th, 3 at 13th, etc., to a maximum of 5 at 19th level.) Any cure spells you cast while the blessed halo is active heal 1 extra hp per die. Finally, good-aligned creatures are impressed with your bearing and demeanor and you gain a +4 sacred bonus to all Charisma-based checks towards such creatures for the duration of the spell.
