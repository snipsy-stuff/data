### 📜 Description
You conjure an immense and extremely violent sand storm. The storm obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Perception checks suffer a -8 penalty. Ranged weapons, other than siege weapons, are impossible to operate; siege weapons suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. Movement through the area is considered difficult terrain even for flying creatures; each square counts as 2 squares of movement.

The swirling sands and debris deal 8d6 bludgeoning damage +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knock them prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the bludgeoning damage and negates being knocked prone. Flying creatures are forced to the ground by the powerful downdraft and take damage as if they fell unless they make a successful Fly check (DC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier), in which case they remain a ttheir original altitude.

Creatures that are knocked prone are buried beneath the sand. Buried creatures are protected from the swirling sands above but take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from the sand's weight per minute spent under the sand. If rendered unconscious, the victim must make a Constitution check (DC 15 + 1 per previous check) each minute or suffer 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. In addition to the aforementioned physical damage, a buried creature also lacks breathable air and immediately starts suffocating. A buried creature can free itself by making a DC 15 Strength check. The DC increases by +2 for each previous failed check. Creatures that aren't buried can dig out their friends in 1 round; however, precisely locating a buried creature requires a DC 25 Perception check.
