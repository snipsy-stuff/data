### 📜 Description
You draw an indelible mark on the subject and declare some area or named location taboo. If the subject subsequently enters the specified area, it suffers 20d6 points of damage per round it remains in that area (no save). The specified area can be no larger than 1 square mile per caster level. If the target is already in the specified area when the spell is cast, nothing happens, but if the target leaves the area and attempts to return, the baneful effects of mark of exile are triggered. Only one mark of exile can affect a creature at any given time. 

The spell leaves an invisible mark upon the target. The target can always sense when it is within 100 feet of the borders of the forbidden area. 

Mark of exile cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse, break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your mark of exile caster level.
