### üìú Description
You transfer a target as greater teleport to another safe location where he remains (with all of his equipment), held entombed in temporal stasis. The subject remains there unless a specific condition is met (see below), someone dispels the temporal stasis, or someone casts a freedom spell at the creature's current location or at the locale where guardian's tomb was originally cast. If freedom is used to free the creature, it reappears where the guardian's tomb was originally cast. 

The creature is released from temporal stasis when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A guardian's tomb cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 17th-level caster can command a guardian's tomb to respond to triggers as far as 255 feet away. Regardless of range, the spell can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.
