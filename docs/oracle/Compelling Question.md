### 📜 Description
You ask another creature one simple question that it can answer with a single word. On the target's next turn, if it fails the save, it must answer you as truthfully as possible as a free action. The GM may assign modifiers to the saving throw based on how important the target considers the information. Asking someone whether she is the king's murderer, for example, involves a closely guarded secret and provides a +2 circumstance bonus. An assassin or inquisitor always gains a +4 competence bonus to this saving throw.
