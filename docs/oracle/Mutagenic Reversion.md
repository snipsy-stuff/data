### 📜 Description
This spell causes a creature mutated by magical forces to revert to its normal state, or at least partially back to normal for a severely mutated creature. This spell suppresses one alchemical mutagen or alchemical discovery that modifies a mutagen, plus one additional such effect for every 5 levels of the caster. Likewise, it suppresses the effects of one polymorph effect or effect which changes the target’s size (e.g., reduce person, righteous might), plus an additional such effect for every 5 levels of the caster. Alchemical discoveries with the highest minimum alchemist level are lost first, as are spells of the highest level. In the case of a tie, randomly determine which is lost. If a lost discovery causes the target to fail to meet the prerequisites for other discoveries, those discoveries are also lost.
