### 📜 Description
You temporarily suppress illusions, invisibility spells (including improved invisibility), transmutation (polymorph) spells, wild shape and change shape abilities as if they were affected by an anti-magic field. The spells are still in effect, just magically suppressed. A creature with improved invisibility appears within the spell, but disappears again if it moves out of the area.
