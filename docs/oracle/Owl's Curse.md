### 📜 Description
You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Wisdom; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl's wisdom do not lose any additional bonus spells for the decreased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells decrease. 

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, owl's wisdom, remove curse, or wish spell. 

Owl's curse counters owl's wisdom.
