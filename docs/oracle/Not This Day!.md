### 📜 Description
This spell marks the target's body with a unique rune that represents its fate. The rune prevents death by a specific type of harm for one day; the type of harm must be specified when this spell is cast.

This harm can be either an energy type (fire, cold, etc.), a broad category of dangerous creature (e.g., such as an animal or a giant), or a specific danger (sword blows, poison, falling, etc.).

For the next 24 hours, the target gain a +4 luck bonus to any saving throws prompted by this kind of attack, and any damage suffered from it is nonlethal. This nonlethal damage does not become lethal if it exceeds the target's maximum hp. However, if creature falls unconscious, this nonlethal damage must be healed before the creature can regain consciousness.

A character can only be under the effects of a single not this day! rune at any time. The rune's magic can be made permanent on the caster or another creature using permanency.
