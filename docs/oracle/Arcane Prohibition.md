### 📜 Description
You imbue the surrounding area with such a strong divine presence that arcane magics have difficulty functioning properly. The air seems to crackle slightly, the way it does just before a major storm, and everything within the barrier appears to glitter as if coated with gold dust. Spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50% for any arcane spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on arcane spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on arcane spells that were already cast before the caster entered the arcane prohibition area of effect.
