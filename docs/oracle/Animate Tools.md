### 📜 Description
The spell causes a tool - or a group of tools used together to perform a task - to animate and perform a task you designate. These tools follow your directions to the best of their abilities, but can only be used for their intended purpose. This spell allows you to complete an amount of work equivalent to a single person working for eight hours. The tools use your Craft or Profession check as appropriate. The tools may aid another. There are many other common uses of this spell that require no check, such as commanding a broom to sweep the floor or a shovel to dig a trench. Only mundane tasks can be accomplished with this spell. It has no effect on crafting magic items. Under no circumstance can tools be used to attack a creature, though items can damage a structure if that is their intended purpose (such as a pick or an axe).
