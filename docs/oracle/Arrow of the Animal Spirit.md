### 📜 Description
You bind powerful animal spirits to an arrow, which you must loose during your next turn for the spell to take effect. If the arrow strikes, ghostly wolves, bears, aurochs, or wildcats appear around its shaft and attack the target. The arrow’s successful hit deals 6d6 hp damage; in addition, you may make a combat maneuver check for the ghostly animals and add a +10 competency bonus to your CMB. This maneuver may be a bull rush, grapple (1 round), trip, or feint.

Regardless of whether you make a successful combat maneuver check, the terrible, ghostly spirits cause a struck target to be frightened for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.
