### 📜 Description
Through a holy ritual, you enchant a vial of holy water to become godsblood, a representation of the blood of your patron deity. Once crafted, the blood can have numerous possible uses, as detailed below. The liquid remains enchanted until one day has passe d, or until it is used. Uses for godsblood are as follows:

1. If drunk, it acts upon the imbiber as if heal (for clerics who turn undead) or harm (for clerics who rebuke undead) had been cast upon him.

2. If anointed to a dead creature's lips, eyes, and chest over the heart, it acts as a raise dead spell. If the recipient is a faithful follower of the cleric's chosen deity, and in good standing with the church, it instead acts as resurrection.

3. If applied to a single weapon or up to 10 missiles such as arrows or sling bullets, the weapon bypasses all damage reduction. This effect lasts 1 minute per five caster levels.

4. If sprinkled over food or drink, it acts as a purify food and drink spell that affects up to four times the normal quantity of provisions.
