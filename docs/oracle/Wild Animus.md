### 📜 Description
This spell animates all inanimate objects within the spell's area of effect up to a maximum of 2 HD per caster level. The animated objects are aggressive and not under the control of the caster in any way. They attack the nearest creatures and damage and destroy whatever they can find. They will not attack each other. 

The sizes of the animated objects depend directly on the sizes of the objects in the area of effect. At the GM's discretion, the caster may designate groups of small like objects to form single larger ones. This spell cast in a cloakroom, for example, could create 16 Small animated cloaks, eight Medium animated pairs of cloaks, four Large four-cloak beasts or a single Huge cloak monster. The caster could not, however, designate a cloak and a chair to become a single animated object. 

Attended objects within the area of effect are not affected by this spell. If a creature's equipment becomes unattended, however, it will become animated.
