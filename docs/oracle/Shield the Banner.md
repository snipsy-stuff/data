### 📜 Description
This spell is used to protect one of a tribe’s most valuable possessions: its tribal banner. Any creature (other than a member of the tribe which the standard represents) attempting to directly attack or touch the standard must make a Will save. This spell functions as sanctuary, but only protects a standard or banner. In addition, the spell grants a +2 bonus to the standard’s hardness, and +10 to the standard’s hit points for the duration of the spell.
