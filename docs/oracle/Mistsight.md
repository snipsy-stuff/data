### 📜 Description
You can see through mist, fog, heavy rain, and other water-based forms of concealment as if they weren't there. For example, a fog cloud spell does not provide any concealment miss chance against your attacks. All non-visual effects of the spell work normally (for example, a stinking cloud nauseates you if you enter it; a solid fog slows you, and so on).
