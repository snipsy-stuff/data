### üìú Description
Bestow affliction causes the target to suffer a permanent physical or mental disability. This curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with the use of break enchantment, remove curse, limited wish, wish, or miracle.

The caster can choose an affliction to bestow from the following list:

Babble: The afflicted's ability to speak coherently is compromised. Any time he attempts to communicate (including casting spells with verbal components), he must make a Will save (DC 16) or whatever he says comes out as gibberish.

Barrenness/Infertility: Certain demons, curses and diseases (and of course, old age) caused people to be unable to produce or bear offspring. This is a touchy subject, and the effects of the affliction might be entirely unimportant in some campaigns. It can be cured by any of the spells listed above, or by a fertile womb spell.

Cataracts: Cataracts are an affliction that permanently degrades one's eyesight (-2 to Search and Spot checks, -4 to attack rolls, and any Dexterity bonus to AC is halved). It can be cured by the spells listed above, or by a combination of the remove disease and cure blindness spells.

Dementia: The afflicted's ability to interact with the real world is compromised. Any time he attempts to take a decisive action, he must make a Wisdom check (DC 13), or act as though under the influence of a confusion spell.

Diseased: The afflicted has suffered physical scars from numerous sicknesses, and he perpetually stinks of infection. He suffers a -5 penalty to his Charisma score.

Ecstatic: The afflicted's ability to understand danger is compromised. In any excited or dangerous situations, he must make a Wisdom check (DC 13), or spend the next 1d4 rounds singing and dancing like a drunk. While in ecstasy he is unable to attack or to use any active defenses. At the end of the madness, make another Wisdom check or the ecstasy continues.

Fixation: The afflicted takes on a quest in search of an unattainable goal (e.g. an imaginary object or impossible ideal) that puts him (and allies) into dangerous situations.

Forgetfulness: The afflicted's ability to remember facts is compromised. Any time he must do something that requires accessing his memory (including casting memorized spells), he must make an Intelligence check (DC 13).

Impotence: The afflicted's ability to participate in sex and to procreate are compromised. This is another touchy subject, and its effects might be entirely unimportant in some campaigns.

Lameness: The afflicted's speed is halved, and he becomes incapable of running or charging. He also suffers a -10 penalty to Acrobatics and Swim skills.

Mute: The afflicted loses the power of speech. He can still make himself understood through writing, and his hearing is unaffected.

Paranoia: The afflicted's ability to separate friend from foe is compromised. Any time someone confronts him with an unexpected situation, he automatically views the other as an enemy and must make a Wisdom check (DC 10) to avoid attacking him.

Phobia: The afflicted develops an irrational fear of a common object, creature, or condition. He believes the object of the phobia poses an immediate threat to him and may even see it where it doesn't exist.

Sickly: The Sickly affliction means that the victim is more likely to contract diseases. A Sickly person always has a low-level cough or fever, and a -4 penalty to saves against disease.
