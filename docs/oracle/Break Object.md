### 📜 Description
This spell damages objects, reducing the object's hitpoint total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total (the object cannot be repaired or gain hit points using this spell). This also causes the object to gain the broken condition; this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. Magic items can be broken by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than the caster level of the object.

This spell also deals 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 5d6) but it cannot reduce the construct's total hit point total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total. When break object is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.
