### üìú Description
This spell creates a 5-foot wide immobile wall of brilliant golden light, illuminating the area within 60 ft. Creatures that pass through or occupy the space where if forms take 1d8 points of sacred damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of sacred damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of sacred damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A construct or inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of sacred damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). Any creature that walks through the wall is illuminated as if by a faerie fire spell for the duration of the spell. Wall of divine light counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but is only dispelled by darkness spells or effects of 7th level or higher. 

While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls of divine light to enclose specific points.
