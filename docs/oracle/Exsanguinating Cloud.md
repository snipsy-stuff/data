### üìú Description
When you cast this spell, a rose-colored mist billows up from the spot you indicate, obscuring sight and draining blood from living creatures.

This cloud obscures sight as fog cloud does and leeches the blood or similar fluid from any creature in the area. Any creature engulfed by the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage. Each round the creature remains in the cloud requires a new Fortitude save to avoid additional Constitution damage.

When it absorbs blood, the cloud gets thicker and darkens to a deep crimson color. Once it has absorbed 10 or more Constitution points, it solidifies. This deep crimson cloud gains the same qualities as solid fog, limiting vision, movement, and attacks.

Undead creatures within an exsanguinating cloud gain a +2 resistance to the Will save allowed by the Turn Undead feat, but otherwise suffer the obscuring effects of being within the cloud.

An exsanguinating cloud cannot be cast underwater. Before it solidifies, it can be dispersed by wind as if it were a fog cloud. Once an exsanguinating cloud has solidified, only very strong winds (50 mph or more) can disperse it. When exsanguinating cloud ends, its remnants shower over the spell area as a rain of blood.

Some necromancers and death clerics use this spell to drain blood from large numbers of creatures and collect it for various purposes, using urns, jugs, or other means to hold the liquid.
