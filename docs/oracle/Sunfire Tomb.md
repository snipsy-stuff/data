### 📜 Description
You transfer a target, body and soul, into the sun, where he remains (with all of his equipment), held entombed in stasis forever. For the subject, time ceases to flow and he grows no older. His bodily functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm him. He is, however, painfully aware of the heat and light around him - those sensations are all he experiences while entombed in the sun. The subject remains there unless someone casts a freedom spell at the locale where sunfire tomb was originally cast, whereupon the subject reappears in that locale. Magical search by scrying, a locate creature spell, or similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is entombed, but discern location does. A miracle or wish spell will not free the recipient but will reveal where he is entombed. The sunfire tomb spell functions only if the target's name and some facts about his life are known.
