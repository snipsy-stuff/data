### 📜 Description
You temporarily transform a shield into a tool, weapon, or other item of your choice with a volume and mass no greater than the shield (there's no minimum shield size) and of any material of your choice (that you have touched before).

Your shield could become a lockpick, bucket, grapnel, stake, trumpet, shackles, or darning needle. It could be made from pure silver, adamantine, ruby, or glass. It gains the usual strength and durability of the material you've chosen. If broken, it instantly reverts to the intact shield it began as (if it's inside a living body or confined space, it teleports harmlessly out in a random direction far enough to get clear before it reverts to its original state). If you are touching the transformed shield, you can as a swift action make it revert to its shield form before the spell expires (ending the spell by doing so).
