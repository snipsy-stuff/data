### 📜 Description
You subsume another creature, including all of its gear, into yourself for the duration of the spell. No time passes for the subsumed creature, all of its bodily functions cease, and no force or effect can act upon it. Effectively, it cannot be harmed or magically detected, although it also cannot perceive anything or act while this spell is in effect.

When the spell expires or is removed, such as by a successful dispel magic spell, the creature appears in the safest adjacent square. While the creature remains inside you, scrutiny reveals the subsumed creature's image reflected in your eyes-an effect that betrays kidnappers and poachers. This spell can be made permanent with the permanency spell, though the subsumed creature may make a Will save again to negate the permanency effect. This spell can be cast on a dead creature as long as it has been dead for no longer than 1 day per your level. If you target a dead creature with this spell, that creature's body receives a Will save with its appropriate bonus to negate this effect, and it receives a second Will save if you or another creature try to make this effect permanent.
