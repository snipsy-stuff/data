### 📜 Description
You summon a number of phantasmal crewmen, each of them a translucent, vaguely human-shaped force that performs the duties of one crew member on a vehicle or piece of siege equipment. It can tie off ropes, hoist sails, swab decks, load powder and ammunition, and other such duties. An unseen crew member possesses no other skills. It cannot speak, nor can it defend itself or fight other than to load and fire siege weapons as directed. It otherwise functions as an unseen servant.

A phantasmal crewman has an AC of 10 +1/2 your caster level, a Strength score of 10, and a Profession (sailor) score equal to half your caster level. It is proficient with all siege weapons and can make attacks with such weapons using your base attack bonus. It cannot fly, but it can climb, swim, or walk with a base speed of 20 feet. It can only be affected by spells that affect other spells (such as dispel magic) and those that affect objects (including most damaging spells), and always fails any saving throw it is required to make. A phantasmal crewman dissipates if it takes more than 1 point of damage per caster level you possess.

If you attempt to send a phantasmal crewman beyond the spell’s range (measured from your current position), it winks out of existence instantly.
