### 📜 Description
When the caster kisses her target as part of this spell, the subject must make a Fortitude save. If his Fortitude save is successful, he sustains 3d6 hit points of damage +1 point/caster level. If the subject fails the saving throw, he is destined to die, immediately, at the moment of the caster's death, or at any point within the next 12 hours when the caster makes a special gesture (at the time of casting she must choose which condition will apply). If the caster chooses to trigger the spell with a gesture and refuses or fails to make that gesture within the 12 hours, the spell is negated. Range does not affect the caster's gesture.
