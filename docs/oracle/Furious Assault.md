### 📜 Description
You imbue the recipients with improved combat abilities, allowing each creature using the full attack action to make an extra attack with any weapon it holds. The attack is made using the recipient's full base attack bonus plus any appropriate modifiers, but this effect is not cumulative with similar effects (such as that provided by a weapon of speed or a haste spell), nor does it actually grant an extra action (and so can't be used to cast a second spell, take an additional move action, and so on.) All recipients gain +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Reflex saves. Any condition that would make a creature lose its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) also makes it lose these bonuses.
