### 📜 Description
You manifest an impulse of greed so overpowering that the target is compelled to offer up whatever it has in its hands to attempt to satisfy you. The creature moves toward you at its best speed, moving to avoid obvious dangers en route to you. Once within reach, the target gives you whatever it holds in its hands (or wears on its hands or wrists) owns, and as an immediate action you can take possession of the item as long as you have a free hand. If you do not take the item by the end of your next turn, the compulsion ends. The target is not prevented from defending itself if attacked. The spell has no effect if the target has no means of moving toward you to deliver its gift, including if it is restrained from moving or faced with an impassable or obviously dangerous barrier, such as a wall of fire.
