### 📜 Description
You target one creature, which if it fails its initial Will save, suffers 8 points of temporary Cha damage and a -8 penalty to all Skill checks, as it is overcome with feelings of grief. Each round thereafter, the target is allowed a new Will save, the success of which reduces the Cha damage and penalty by 1 each. Remove depression counters and dispels inconsolable grief.
