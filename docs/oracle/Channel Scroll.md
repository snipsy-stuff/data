### üìú Description
This spell enables you to channel your own power through a scroll to activate its magic. If the spell is on your spell list, you can expend a free spell slot or a prepared spell of the same level to cast the spell without expending the scroll's magic. Alternatively, you can expend a prepared spell or a spell slot of two levels higher to cast the spell at your own caster level using your DC.

If the scroll's spell is not on your spell list, or if you don't have a spell or spell slot of the appropriate level available, you can still try to channel the scroll, but success is not guaranteed. In that case, expend a prepared spell or spell slot of at least first level and make a Spellcraft check.

The DC for this check is 15 + twice the level of the spell on the scroll. If the spell is on your caster list, you gain a +5 bonus to this check. If the check is successful, the spell is cast without consuming the scroll. If the check is failed by 5 or less, the spell is still cast, but the magic of the scroll is consumed in the process. If the check fails by 6 or more, the spell is not cast, and the scroll is destroyed in the attempt.

Channel scroll can't affect scrolls of 4th level or higher. A scroll can only be targeted by this spell once per day.
