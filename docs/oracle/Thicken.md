### 📜 Description
Once this spell is cast you are able to manipulate small objects made from organic materials such as wood, wool, linen, etc. You can increase, or even decrease, their thickness and strength. For example, you are able to thicken a woolen shirt into a warm winter-proof covering or a change a thin, hemp rope into a hardy cord capable of withstanding a Medium creature's weight. The object you wish to manipulate can't have a volume greater than 1 cubic foot and must be made of organic material. You can increase or decrease the hardness and hp possessed by the item by 10% per caster level (max 50%). This spell won't work on metal armor or weapons because they are not made of organic materials. While you couldn't increase the AC value of a suit of leather armor, you could alter its ability to withstand damage for a short period of time. Objects that already have some form of enchantment or magical nature cannot be affected by this spell.
