### 📜 Description
You summon the attention of Veles, the World Serpent, for the briefest of instants, and his fury is profound. Creatures that fail their saves are stunned for 2d4 rounds and are then shaken and staggered for the remainder of the spell's duration. A successful save leaves the target shaken for the spell's duration.

Dragonkin, creatures of the draconic subtype, and reptile animals receive a +4 bonus to their Will saves.
