### 📜 Description
Perhaps no light shines with more goodness or is more beautiful than the light of the celestial planes itself. With this spell, the caster summons a portion of this heavenly light to weaken and inflict damage upon powerful evil beings, evil extraplanar creatures, devils, demons, and undead. All creatures with the Evil subtype, all evil-aligned creatures with an aura that radiates its alignment, and all undead within the area of effect suffer 1d6 points of holy damage per caster level (maximum 25d6). Those creatures that have a particular vulnerability to sunlight takes half again as much (+50%) damage, based on the type of creature you're affecting. The spell also inflicts a secondary effect based on the type of creature affected:

• Evil Subtype: Inflicts the blindness condition • Evil Aura: Inflicts the exhausted condition • Undead: Turned (as if by a successful use of turn undead)

A successful Reflex save results in half damage and negates the secondary effect.
