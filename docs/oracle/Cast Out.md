### 📜 Description
This spell sends a target whose name you utter away from this plane and into a dimension of your choosing; even if the target normally has the ability to return (or to travel to any other plane), he cannot do so. A successful Will save results in the spell dealing 10d6 points of damage instantaneously to the creature instead.

This spell cannot be dispelled though it can be removed with a freedom, miracle, or wish spell cast on the spot from which the creature was cast out. The damage dealt by this spell cannot be healed magically by any conjuration (healing) effect of 8th level or lower. The damage also does not heal naturally or via fast healing though it can be regenerated; if the regeneration is granted by a spell it will not function against this damage if the spell is 8th level or lower.
