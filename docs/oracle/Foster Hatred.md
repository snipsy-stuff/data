### 📜 Description
You poison the minds of the targets, filling them with malice and hatred for members of a certain group. This can include creatures of a specific creature subtype, or of a specific kind within a type that has no subtypes (e.g., red dragons, minotaurs, or treants). The target group may also be a member of a religious, national, or ethnic group, assuming those affiliations are visibly apparent to affected creatures. Foster hatred can compel creatures to hate a group of which they are a part, though this grants them a +4 bonus to the saving throw.

Foster hatred shifts the targets’ reactions with creatures of their hated group negatively by one step, and they are always treated as enemies rather than allies for creatures of that type. They are not actually compelled to attack their hated creatures, but they will act within their normal resources and ethics to hinder, demean, or abuse those they hate. They cannot provide flanking for a hated creature, and they automatically provide flanking for an enemy that flanks a hated creature with them. They are not considered allies or willing targets for the purpose of spells and similar effects (including nominally harmless effects) or allowing movement through their space. If a member of a hated group ever becomes helpless while adjacent to an affected creature, the hated creature is compelled to perform a coup de grace on the hated creature (Will negates; making this saving throw does not remove the foster hatred spell but does prevent acting on the compulsion to perform a coup de grace against that creature).
