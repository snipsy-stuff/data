### 📜 Description
This enchantment causes all targets within range to become utterly insensible. A target succumbing to sensory deprivation effectively becomes blinded and deafened, and the target also feels no pain. In addition to blindness and deafness, the target incurs a -8 penalty on all saves, as it cannot react appropriately to any stimuli.

A target that takes damage gains another Will save to shake off the spell's effects. Otherwise, limited wish or more powerful magic is required to remove this spell.
