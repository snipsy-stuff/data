### 📜 Description
You or one touched spell recipient will feel a continuous, faint tingling as this spell works. The target does not get tired or suffer any effects of fatigue, including loss of alertness, drowsiness, and damaged concentration. The target remains awake, alert, and fresh.

If multiple unsleeping spells are cast upon you or another target before existing ones expire, this augmentation can continue indefinitely. However, when the unsleeping effect ends, the target can't enjoy the benefits of unsleeping again until twice the total length of the previous effect has elapsed.

Most shieldmaidens use unsleeping sparingly in desperate situations where forced marches, prolonged guardianship, or lengthy sentinel duty are vital.
