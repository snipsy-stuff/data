### 📜 Description
Your spell awakens seething rage in a targeted creature, rendering it incoherent and unable to cast even the simplest magic or use any verbal skills or abilities. It splutters, gesticulates, and hops about in a fit of pure temper for the spell's duration. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.

Non-spellcasting targets gain a +2 bonus to melee attacks and damage rolls they make while under this spell's influence. Affected creatures cannot take any action other than combat attacks while the spell continues.
