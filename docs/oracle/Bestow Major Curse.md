### üìú Description
As the original spell (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook) except that the following major curses are also available.

‚Ä¢ Becoming An Ass: The accursed acquires the ears and tail of a donkey, buck teeth, large snorting nostrils, and a propensity to snort. A remove curse spell only grants a second saving throw, if this second save is failed, additional remove curse spells have no effect.

‚Ä¢ Drought: If the accursed tries to raise crops, they shrivel and die.

‚Ä¢ False Justice: The accursed is repeatedly accused of crimes he didn't commit. Furthermore, he is utterly unconvincing when defending himself against these charges, suffering a -4 penalty to all Charisma and Charisma-based skill checks when attempting to talk his way out of trouble.

‚Ä¢ Flame Prone: Any time there's fire within 30 ft. of the accursed, he must make a Reflex save (same DC as this spell), or a spark flies into his lap and sets him on fire, doing 1d4 damage that round and igniting his clothing unless he makes a second Reflex save.

‚Ä¢ Homeless: Neither spell nor effort of foot nor force of will suffices to allow the accursed to return to his home. Any attempt to teleport there fails; any journey is misled so the accursed stays away.

‚Ä¢ House of Fire: Every time the accursed sleeps under the roof of a friend or relative or of a home of his own, he must make a Will save (same DC as this spell) or the dwelling is consumed by fire.

‚Ä¢ Into an Enemy's Hands: That thing which is most precious to the accursed (a spouse, a jewel, a weapon, an honor, a title) falls into the hands of a hated enemy.

‚Ä¢ Loss of Limb: One of the accursed's limbs withers and becomes useless.

‚Ä¢ Nameless: No one remembers the accursed's name, except to curse it or associate it with evil deeds. No good deed committed by the accursed is remembered.

‚Ä¢ Plague Carrier: Anyone who spends more than one hour a day in the company of the accursed must make a Fortitude save (same DC as this spell) or contract a random disease (see contagion spell); this check must be made daily. The accursed himself doesn't contract any disease as a result of this curse.

‚Ä¢ Stench of the Dead: The accursed smells like a festering corpse. His Charisma suffers an effective -5 penalty.

‚Ä¢ Tongue of the Liar: The accursed is unable to tell the truth, even to save his life. His lies are almost always interpreted in ways that get him in trouble.

‚Ä¢ The Water Shall Devour Him: Every time the accursed passes near a body of water or boards a ship, something happens to throw him into the water.

‚Ä¢ Unexpected Enemy: A previously unknown family member of the accursed (typically a son or a half-brother) wants him dead.
