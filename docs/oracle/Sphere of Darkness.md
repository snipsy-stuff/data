### 📜 Description
You can summon forth a 5-ft. wide sphere of utter darkness, which moves as you direct. Any creature within the sphere is considered to be in pitch black darkness, devoid of all light, and suffers all the penalties such a state entails. You can, each round as a standard action, move the sphere up to 25 feet in any direction, including upward. Creatures occupying the space wherein you direct the sphere are allowed a Reflex save to avoid the effects of the sphere for that round. Creatures with darkvision are unaffected by the sphere.
