### 📜 Description
You speak a holy word and perform a simple ritual ensure that one undead creature does not return. Once an undead creature with rejuvenation "destroyed," you must cast this spell on its physical remains. In the case of a ghost, you must locate the creature's body, bones, or specific area or item that the ghost haunts and cast the spell there. A failed Will saving throw permanently destroys the undead creature.
