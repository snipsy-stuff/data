### 📜 Description
A whirling barrier of boulders and other slates of stone spins rapidly around you. The greater earth barrier gives you cover and absorbs damage directed at you, effectively giving you DR 15/O. The greater earth barrier lasts until it has absorbed a total of 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 300 points). 

The barrier also deals damage to any creatures that make melee attacks against you, even with a reach weapon. Such attacks deal damage normally (adjusted by the DR), but the attacker takes 3d6 points of magical bludgeoning damage from the whirling stones at the same time. Creatures that move into your square (most commonly opponents attempting to grapple you, or Tiny and smaller creatures), or creatures that pull you into their space, instead take 6d6 points of magical bludgeoning damage each round. If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures take this damage only once per round, regardless of how many melee attacks they make against you.
