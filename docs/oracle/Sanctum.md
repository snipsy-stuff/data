### üìú Description
You transport yourself to an extradimensional sanctuary just large enough to hold you and what you hold or carry. If you have a familiar or other companion creature with the share spells ability, that creature can accompany you into the sanctuary if it is touching you or within 5 feet when you cast the spell. While in the sanctuary, you can cast spells that target you, your equipment, or your bonded companion, use skills, or take other actions. Any spell you cast within the sanctuary is automatically quickened (cast at normal levels without your needing to know the Quicken Spell feat), though you can still cast only one quickened spell each round (this allows you to perform a nonspellcasting standard action and cast a spell but not cast two spells in a round, while within the sanctum). Spells from magic items (including scrolls) are not affected, nor are spell-like abilities, other special abilities, or spells that you've already quickened. When sanctum ends, you reappear where you had been when you cast the spell. If this location contains a solid object, you appear in the nearest open space. 

Spells and abilities that move you within a plane (such as teleport and dimension door), do not function within the sanctuary, although a plane shift spell allows you to exit to whatever plane the spell designates.
