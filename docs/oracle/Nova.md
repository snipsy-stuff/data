### 📜 Description
You glow with a light of increasing intensity-eventually, you become nearly unbearable to look at directly

You may concentrate for up to four rounds, increasing the spell's power each round. Concentrating on this spell is a standard action. At any point during your turn, you may release this spell's energy as an immediate action, causing damage to all nearby creatures but not yourself.  The duration spent concentrating causes various effects as indicated below.

1st round: You emit dim light in a 10-ft. radius. Releasing the energy this round deals 2d6 hp force damage to all creatures in a 10-ft. radius.

2nd round: You emit normal light in a 15-ft. radius. Any creature looking directly at you is dazed for 1 round (Will negates); releasing the energy this round deals 4d6 hp force damage to all creatures in a 15-ft. radius.

3rd round: You emit normal light in a 25-ft. radius. Any creature looking directly at the caster is dazzled for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). Releasing the energy this round deals 6d6 hp force damage to all creatures in a 25-ft. radius.

4th round: You emit the equivalent of daylight in a 30-ft. radius. Any creature looking directly at you is blinded for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). The built-up energy must be released this round and deals 10d6 hp force damage to all creatures in a 30-ft. radius. If you fail to release the energy (if you're knocked unconscious or otherwise), you take a full 20d6 hp damage; creatures in the radius are unharmed.
