### 📜 Description
This spell physically sends a target into a nightmare. The victim is actually cast into a shrieking maelstrom of nightmares on the Plane of Dreams where it can take no actions but observe. The victim physically returns 2d4 rounds later from its original locale. The victim takes 4d6 points of Wisdom damage, but is otherwise free to act on the round it returns. A successful Will save causes the creature to blink out briefly and suffer only 2 points of Wisdom damage, and afterwards is immune to that same caster's khan's sending for 24 hours.
