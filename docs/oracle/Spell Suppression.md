### üìú Description
The zone created by spell suppression diminishes the power of any other spell that is cast from within its area of influence. When a spell or spell-like ability is cast within the affected area, reduce the affected caster's effective level by 1 for every 4 levels you possess. If the effective level has been reduced below the minimum required to cast the spell, the affected caster may attempt a level check (DC 5 + your level) at his unmodified level. If the check is successful, the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast the spell; otherwise it is lost.

For example, if a 6th-level cleric attempts to cast searing light from an area affected by an 8th-level witch's spell suppression, the effective level of the cleric's spell would be reduced to 4th level. Since searing light requires at least level 5, the cleric must make a DC 13 level check or lose the spell. If the check is successful, the cleric may cast the spell at level 5.

Spell suppression does not affect ongoing spells already in effect or spells brought into the area (such as enchantments on characters or objects).

Spell suppression can be made permanent with a permanency spell. The minimum level required is 11th, and it costs 7,500 gp.
