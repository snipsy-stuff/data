### 📜 Description
You attach the severed forelimb of another creature to your torso, using it as an additional off-hand. You can use it to make an additional attack in a full-attack action, albeit at a -6 off-hand penalty (reduced to -3 if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat). You can also use it to wield a shield at no penalty (you can wield only one shield at a time). Additionally, you can hold objects or weapons in two hands and still cast spells with somatic components. When the spell ends, the limb falls off painfully, dealing 1d3 points of damage and impeding your concentration.

You also can use this spell to attach a limb to the stump of one of your limbs that has been severed. In this case, the spell's duration changes to Instantaneous, and you may gain some special property of the limb if it has any (a troll's arm might regenerate, for instance, or a gargoyle's stony arm might function as a shield). The GM may add an XP component if the limb has special properties. If the limb is from a living creature that was not offered freely, the spell gains the Evil descriptor.
