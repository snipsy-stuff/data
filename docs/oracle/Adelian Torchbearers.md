### 📜 Description
Adelian torchbearers combines effects from continual flame and unseen servant. After casting it, you conjure 1d6 mindless, floating force servants. Each emits the equivalent of a heatless, smokeless torch.

They appear wherever you desire within range, and you can verbally or mentally order the invisible servants to move anywhere within range. Otherwise, they automatically spread out in a 30-ft.-radius circle, starting in the square behind you.

The servants emit only torchlight; they may not be commanded to perform other tasks or errands. If they are attacked, the servants are immediately dispelled.

This spell may be made permanent on a person, place, or object with the use of a permanency spell at a cost of 2,500 gp.
