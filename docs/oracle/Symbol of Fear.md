### 📜 Description
This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the symbol of fear instead become panicked for 1 round per caster level.

Note: Magic traps such as symbol of fear are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of fear and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for symbol of fear.
