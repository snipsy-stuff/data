### 📜 Description
This spell allows you to turn a healing potion into a temporary pool of necromantic energy. Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing) spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if detect magic is cast on it while it remains under this spell’s effects.

When you drink a potion affected by this spell you gain no healing. Instead, the first necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion deathwine affects. For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks deathwine made from a potion of cure serious wounds would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster.

In addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) benefits from a potion affected by deathwine as per the potion’s normal effects. Any healing potion not imbibed before this spell’s duration expires is destroyed.
