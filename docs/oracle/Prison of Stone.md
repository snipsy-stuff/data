### üìú Description
You call upon the earth to reach forth and seize your foes. To be affected, a creature within the spell's area must be within 10 feet of the ground, or in contact with another earthen or stone surface. When you cast this spell, massive clawed hands of stone erupt from the ground to snatch at creatures in the area. Make a melee touch attack against each creature with a +5- circumstance bonus. If a touch attack hits, that hand partially fuses with the opponent's body and makes a combat maneuver check (CMB equal to your caster level plus your caster ability modifier plus a +5 circumstance bonus).

The prison of stone attempts to dispel (as described in greater dispel magic) any and all spells or magic items on the touched creature that directly or indirectly interfere with the grapple or encapsulation (see below) taking effect. For example, a character casts prison of stone and touches a subject with freedom of movement. A dispel check is made (DC 11 + the caster level of the freedom of movement). If the dispel succeeds, the spell is dispelled before the grapple check is made. Prison of stone's dispelling can only affect spells cast upon a creature or object. Independent spell effects or those affecting an area cannot be dispelled, even if they prevent the prison of stone from affecting the touched creature. 

Prison of stone can dispel spells and magic items specifically intended to foil the spell in question (spell immunity), that provide general protection from spells (spell resistance), and/or offer any bonuses to combat maneuvers, grapples, or Escape Artist checks. You make a check for each instance of protection; an affected magic item is suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds. If the hand maintains the grapple, on the following round it attempts to pin the grappled opponent. A pinned creature takes 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage as the stone begins to spread and coalesce into a hard sphere of solid rock. One full round after the creature is pinned it is completely encapsulated in the sphere. It is held immobile and helpless, taking 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round from the pressure. It must also hold its breath or begin to suffocate. 

Creatures can attempt to break free from the grasping hands by succeeding on a DC 30 Strength check. Once the stone sphere has completely formed, the Strength check DC increases to 35. Once encapsulated a victim cannot use Escape Artist to break free of the prison of stone. 

Disintegrate, freedom or similar magic can destroy the stone sphere, as can dealing at least 50 points of damage to a sphere with a weapon (the stone has hardness 8). However, a trapped creature takes half of any damage dealt to the stone with weapon attacks.
