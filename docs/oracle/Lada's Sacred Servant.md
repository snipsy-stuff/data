### 📜 Description
You summon a small ball of light, similar in appearance to a will-o'-wisp, that hovers about a foot off the ground. As a move action, you can direct the sacred servant to move to and touch one living target in range, restoring hp equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier.

The sacred servant cannot make attack rolls and thus cannot use its positive energy to damage undead or other creatures damaged by positive energy.

The sacred servant cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it normally.

If a touched creature has spell resistance, make a level check (1d20 + level) against that spell resistance the first time the sacred servant touches the creature. If the sacred servant is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sacred servant has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
