### 📜 Description
This spell functions like symbol of death (see the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game), except each creature within the radius of a symbol of despair is afflicted with a sense of utter despair for 1 minute per caster level. Each affected creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of despair has no hit point limit - once triggered, a symbol of despair simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Magic traps such as symbol of despair are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of despair and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 29 for symbol of despair.
