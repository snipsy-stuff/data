### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, the touched creatures do not need to breathe at all. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. This spell enables the subjects to survive underwater, in the void of space, and so on without breathing.

Breathlessness renders the subjects immune to inhaled poisons and provides a +4 bonus to saving throws against abilities that rely on a sense of smell (such as a troglodyte's stench attack).
