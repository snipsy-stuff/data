### 📜 Description
This spell allows one person to ignore the effects of fatigue. He doesn't need to make checks related to fatigue, nor Fortitude saves against environmental conditions such as desert heat, nor is his speed affected by the amount of gear he carries (although he still suffers armor check penalties and penalties to skills such as Acrobatics and Swim).
