### 📜 Description
You cause a stationary cloud of icy vapor to rise all around you. The vapor partially obscures sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Obscured creatures and objects gain concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). In addition, all creatures take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage (treat as cold damage for the purpose of resistance) each round they remain in the mist. Creatures are entitled to a Fortitude save each round to halve the damage.

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the mist in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage. This spell does not function underwater.
