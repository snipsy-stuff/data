### üìú Description
You create a translucent blue protective sphere around yourself and your surroundings. The sphere is immobile and you cannot leave the area of the sphere or the spell ends. You can resize the sphere as an immediate action every round, up to its maximum size. Those within the sphere are impervious to all ranged attacks, whether physical (arrows, javelins, and falling boulders) or magical (spells, spell-like abilities, and super natural abilities). Likewise, such attacks cannot be launched from within the confines of the sphere at targets outside its area. No creature can pass through the barrier, either way, without your conscious consent (although it is a free action for you to allow it), so melee attacks through the sphere are impossible as well. (Creatures with your mental permission can move through the sphere and make melee attacks, but then they are outside its confines.) Creatures cannot pass through the sphere more than once per casting of the spell, even with your permission. You can never make attacks through the sphere or move outside it without ending the spell. Environmental threats, from poison gas to horrible cold or a raging fire, do not affect those within the area of the sphere - the interior is always safe and comfortable.

If you change the size of the sphere, you do not "drag" creatures or objects. If your reshaping the sphere would cause something to no longer be within its confines, the sphere passes through it harmlessly. Thus, the sphere can pass through the ground, walls, or stationary objects without problem and its size is not subject to the limits of line of effect. Even magical movement - such as teleportation, ethereal travel, or creatures moving incorporeally - does not allow passage through the sphere if you do not wish it. Likewise, conjured creatures, objects, or energies cannot appear within the area of the shell without your consent if the conjurer is outside it.
