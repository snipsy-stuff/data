### 📜 Description
This spell evokes a larger piece of celestial matter, the impact of which mirrors a natural meteorite impact. 

A superior meteorite screams down from space three months after the casting of this spell, leaving a visible tail in the sky as it approaches over the course of this time. This spell can be cast only when the target is under the open sky or under no more than 10 feet of solid rock; if the target is moved during that time, the spell fails. At the time of impact it leaves a scarlet trail of smoke and a thunderous roar. 

All within 50 feet of the impact point take 50d6 points of damage, those out to 100 feet away take 25d6 points of damage, those out to 150 feet away take 12d6 points of damage, and those out to 200 feet away take 6d6 points of damage. This damage is half bludgeoning damage and half fire damage. Successful Reflex saving throws reduce damage by half. Creatures in the radius are knocked prone whether or not they make their saves. The crater that results from a superior meteorite strike measures 50 feet in diameter and 30 feet deep.
