### üìú Description
Excommunicate allows a cleric to cast a member of her faith out of her church and the sight of her god. You can only cast this spell if you are an official representative of the church and you cannot use it on a person who holds a higher rank within the church than you do. When you cast a ban, you must state the crime that your target has committed against your church; this message is limited to 100 words and will be relayed to the target by a whispering wind along with the name of caster. Under normal circumstances no saving throw is allowed. However, if the target is a member of your church and is innocent of the crime that you've accused her of, she may negate the spell with a successful Will save. 

Excommunicate prevents a target from casting atonement and excommunicate. However, when you cast it on a member of your faith the effects are far more severe. If the victim is a divine spellcaster, she loses the ability to receive spells or channel energy. A paladin also loses all her mercy abilities, but keeps her other class abilities. Regardless of her class, the victim cannot benefit from divine spells of her (former) faith - although she can still suffer the effects of hostile magic. If a cleric of her faith attempts to cast a beneficial spell on her, he will sense her status; the spell is lost, but the cleric knows why it failed. 

There are no visible signs of excommunication. Under normal circumstances, it can only be discovered by trying to cast a beneficial spell on the target. If the victim is revealed as an excommunicate, the attitudes of any NPCs who share the faith will be reduced by at least one category. In some religions the faithful are not allowed to interact with those who have been excommunicated; if this is the case, the victim will probably be exiled as part of her sentence. 

Any higher-ranking priest from your church can remove your ban, if she herself is not under the effects of a curse such as excommunicate; she simply makes a formal statement absolving your victim of her crime. Alternately, a lower-level priest of your religion may help your victim by casting atonement on her behalf - although if the victim did commit the crime of which you accused her, she must honestly repent her actions. Otherwise, the only way to remove the ban is through a miracle or wish. Note that "higher-ranking" does not necessarily mean "of higher level."
