### üìú Description
You create a one-way conduit between yourself and a target living creature, such that any damage or harmful effects that are redirected to you are instead directed from you to the subject. Whenever you would take hit point damage or ability damage from an attack, or would suffer the effects of ability score drain, death attacks, disease, energy drain, petrification, poison, or polymorphing, the subject of this spell is treated as the target of the attack or effect. The subject is entitled to a saving throw if the effect allows one, and can apply spell resistance and other resistances as normal. For example, fire damage dealt to you would be redirected to a target creature with fire immunity (or under the effect of an appropriate protection from energy spell), but the creature would take none of the redirected damage. 

Pain circuit redirects damage and effects whether from a targeted spell (such as scorching ray) or an area effect (such as being caught in the area of a cone of cold). However, the spell has no effect on effects that do not fit into one of the above categories (including mind-affecting or enchantment spells or effects, or possession by a magic jar spell). 

You can intentionally target yourself with an attack (magical or otherwise) in order to affect the target. However, whenever you are subjected to an effect that allows a saving throw, you must attempt your saving throw before the effect is passed on to the spell's subject. You are not allowed to voluntarily fail your saving throw or lower your spell resistance against any harmful effects while pain circuit is active.

If the spell's subject is slain, the spell ends. If a spellcaster casts pain circuit on another spellcaster who has pain circuit already active, both spells end immediately and both casters take 6d6 points of damage from magical feedback.
