### 📜 Description
This spell functions like spiritual weapon except it creates a black, scythe-shaped force that deals 2d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10 at 20th level). If the weapon scores a critical hit, it does quadruple damage, and, if the critical was caused by a natural 20, the target must also make a Fortitude save or suffer an additional 10 damage per caster level. If the total damage from this strike is enough to kill or destroy the target, the weapon severs the target's head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads.
