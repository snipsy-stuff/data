### 📜 Description
You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Constitution; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit points return when the subject's Constitution returns to normal.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a bear's endurance, break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.

Bear's curse counters bear's endurance.
