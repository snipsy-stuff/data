### 📜 Description
A light bluish-green cloud of mist billows out from the point you designate. Intelligent creatures within the vapors drop all held items and fall prone, they are immobile and gain the helpless condition taking no actions other than writhing and shuddering in blissful ecstasy as their senses are overloaded with stimulation. Victims in this state ignore all external stimuli including physical damage, which they seem to enjoy based upon their strange facial expressions. When the spell ends, affected creatures have no memory of what happened to them, and they suffer the fatigued condition. A successful save negates all the preceding effects but the subject is staggered for 1 round, and is immune to all the preceding effects of this spell including its staggering effect for 24 hours. Non-intelligent creatures are immune to the effects of this spell. 

The mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). 

A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.
