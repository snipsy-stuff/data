### 📜 Description
You sing a gentle and soothing lullaby that puts all willing listeners to sleep for one hour. When they awaken from their slumber, lost hit points and ability damage are restored as if they had received a full night's rest. Fatigue and exhaustion are also eliminated. To gain the beneficial effects of this spell, the recipients must focus their undivided attention on you while you cast the spell. If they are otherwise distracted, then they do not gain any benefits from the spell, but they do not fall asleep either. Sleeping creatures can be awoken in the same manner as a sleep spell. Unwilling creatures are unaffected by this spell. A creature may only receive the benefits of this spell once every five days.
