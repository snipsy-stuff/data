### 📜 Description
This spell functions as symbol of death, except the spell does not cause death. Instead, symbol of condemnation marks all creatures that fail a Will save in the spell's 60-ft. burst with a glowing, scarlet-red symbol of condemnation somewhere visible on the creature's body (GM's choice).

Any intelligent creature that views the symbol of condemnation on a creature immediately shifts their attitude toward the affected creature to unfriendly, and the marked creature must make Diplomacy checks while interacting with it. Additionally, creatures marked with a symbol of condemnation act unfriendly to each other.

The symbol of condemnation remains visible on the creature for one day per level unless magically dispelled.

Any guards or lawful officials who view the inflicted creature may make an Intelligence check to determine if the inflicted should be judged for their crimes.

Symbol of condemnation can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.
