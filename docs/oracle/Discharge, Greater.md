### 📜 Description
This spell functions as discharge, except it can discharge multiple technological objects and can be used to target an area.

You choose to use greater discharge in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.

Area Discharge: When greater discharge is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature's possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.

Targeted Discharge: This spell functions as discharge, but if the target is a creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target's charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you possess.
