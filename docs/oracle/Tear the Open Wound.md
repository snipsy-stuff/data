### 📜 Description
This spell can only be cast upon a living creature that has sustained at least 1 point of damage from an edged or piercing weapon. With but a gesture, the caster places a potent curse upon the target. An individual affected by this spell is not affected by conjuration (healing), fast healing, natural healing, or regeneration. 

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, wish, or miracle. Remove curse only grants the victim a second saving throw; if this second save is failed, the spell has no further effect.
