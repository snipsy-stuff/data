### 📜 Description
The caster may catch glimpses of the future by gazing into a fire or a pool of water; these glimpses may provide clues of things yet to come. Through these visions, the caster may learn certain future truths surrounding an object, person, place, or event. The GM must determine the images seen. The information comes in a series of visions, images which represent what the GM wishes to convey, but the interpretation of the images is left up to the caster. The spell does not assist in this interpretation. An individual caster may only gain a prophecy once per subject.
