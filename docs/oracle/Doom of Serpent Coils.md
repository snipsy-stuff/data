### 📜 Description
You drink a bottle of venom or other poisons, and through the unholy power of your dark gods, you share the effects with all living things around you. The caster suffers the effects of the poison normally, but so do all those within a 10-ft. radius.

This poison deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction. Once the caster makes such a saving throw (or otherwise neutralizes the poison), the spell ends immediately. Creatures already poisoned by the spell remain poisoned, however, and must make saving throws until they die, succeed on a saving throw, or negate the poison through other means.

The caster may choose to fail the saving throw each round rather than rolling. If he or she does so, all creatures within range suffer a -2 profane penalty to their Fortitude saving throw against this spell.
