### üìú Description
A less powerful version of the spell miracle, this spell allows you to request a boon from the gods in the form of a single magical invocation or intervention. You state what you would like to have happen and request your deity to intercede. If it is within the spell's power to fulfill, the request will be granted.

A minor miracle can do any of the following things.

‚Ä¢ Duplicate any priest spell of 6th level or lower (including spells to which you have access due to your domains).

‚Ä¢ Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.

‚Ä¢ Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.

‚Ä¢ Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7 penalty on its next saving throw.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th level spell. When a minor miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1.000 gp, you must provide the component (although a second minor miracle may be invoked beforehand as a means of acquiring said component). If a spell or effect can be overcome with a limited wish (such as bestow curse) it can also be overcome by minor miracle.
