### 📜 Description
You conjure a small planar trap that opens beneath the target creature that creates a burst of suction pulling the target creature into a spherical containment cell of the same height and width as the longest dimension of the trapped creature. A successful Reflex save avoids the trap completely. Rogues may add their trap sense modifier to this save. A trapped creature can attempt to break the walls of their enclosure to force the spell to end early (hardness 8, hp equal to caster); otherwise they must simply wait for the spell to end. Once the spell ends the victim is violently ejected from the earth taking 8d6 points of physical damage and ending up prone in the spot they originally occupied. If the space they were in is occupied, they are shunted in a random direction to the closest open square.

As a magical, quasi-planar opening; spells such as ethereal jaunt, teleport, dimension door, or related spells don't function. The stone snare can be dispelled normally from either the inside or outside ending the spell as above.
