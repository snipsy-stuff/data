### 📜 Description
You rally your allies, alleviating their fatigue or exhaustion, raising their position to the top of the initiative order, and granting them a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects.

Affected allies' initiative order is determined in descending order by their initiative bonuses. If two or more allies have identical initiative bonuses, those allies should roll to determine in which order they act. Affected allies who are fatigued or exhausted are not affected by those conditions while this spell is in effect, but when this spell's duration is over, those conditions continue to effect the allies as if this spell was not cast.

This spell cannot affect the same ally multiple times per casting, and multiple castings do not stack. During the spell's duration, it continues to affect allies that move out of range. When the spell expires, the spell effect vanishes for all allies affected, regardless of when they were affected.
