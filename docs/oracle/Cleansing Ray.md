### 📜 Description
You direct a ray of negative energy that is harmful to simple organisms. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if the ray hits an ooze or plant creature, it deals 1d6 hp damage. You may instead target a square (AC 5), destroying a 5-ft. patch of non-creature fungus, mold, or slime and disinfecting unattended, non-magical objects in the square. Objects tainted with magical or unusual diseases, parasites, or infestations are unaffected by this spell.
