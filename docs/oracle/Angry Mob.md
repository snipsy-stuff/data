### 📜 Description
You create a stationary crowd of illusory commoners of any humanoid race desired. You can generally shape their nondescript appearance, but they cannot be made to resemble any specific individual(s). The angry mob threatens and menaces creatures within, shouting and muttering unintelligibly while brandishing fists and cudgels, and anyone in the area is treated as flanked unless it has disbelieved the illusion. In addition, the angry mob has limited substance and impedes vision and movement like an actual crowd, even if a creature has disbelieved the illusion. Unlike a real crowd, and angry mob does not provide cover to creatures within it and cannot be forced to move with Diplomacy or Intimidate checks.While you are standing within or adjacent to the angry mob, you gain a bonus to Intimidate checks equal to half your caster level (maximum +5). This bonus does not apply against creatures that have disbelieved the illusion.
