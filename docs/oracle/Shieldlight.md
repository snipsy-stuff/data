### 📜 Description
You enspell an existing shield (of any size and material, as long as you can hold and use it) to give off a steady, gentle, translucent, pearly-white light in a 20-ft. radius, and increasing the light level for an additiona 20 ft. by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). As long as you are alive, this light persists even in your absence until the spell expires. While a shield is affected by shieldlight, it gains a +1 bonus (both as a weapon, and in augmenting a bearer's AC).
