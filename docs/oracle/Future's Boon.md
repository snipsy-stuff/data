### 📜 Description
Only clerics with the luck domain gain access to this spell. You may make any one d20 roll (typically a check or attack roll) twice, then take the better of the two results. The subject must choose which die roll to affect before the roll is made, at which point the spell discharges. You may only be under the effect of one future's boon at a time.
