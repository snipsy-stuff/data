### 📜 Description
The zone of parley is a special fortified sanctuary. When it is set up, anyone who enters it is compelled to proclaim whether he will respect the truce of the zone; this declaration is a free action. If he agrees to honor the truce, he is protected by a sanctuary spell until he leaves the zone. However, he must make a Will save to make any attack (even in response to another's attacks on him) within the zone, and suffers 6d8 points of divine damage even if he successfully makes his save. He loses his sanctuary when he attempts to commit an act that violates the zone, but must continue to make saving throws when he attempts to commit further acts of violence (and suffers the damage). The zone of parley is most commonly used during parlays in battle.
