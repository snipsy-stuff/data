### 📜 Description
The target gains a comprehensive understanding of the tenets of your faith, granting a +5 competence bonus to Knowledge (religion) checks relating to questions of your faith. Even after the spell fades, the target remains as familiar with your religion as if she had actually read its holy book or the equivalent repository of dogma and lore (make untrained checks of DC 15 or lower for one month).
