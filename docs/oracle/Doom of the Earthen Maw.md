### üìú Description
The ground within 30 ft. of the point the caster designates turns to a filthy and slippery muck, drawing all those in the area down into a watery death.

Creatures within the area all gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is difficult terrain while the effect lasts, and all creatures within it are flat-footed. 
The depth of the muck grows deeper each round, and some creatures may find it impossible to escape.

In round 1, creatures within the area of effect sink to about 3 ft. deep unless they leave the area of the spell.

In round 2, the earthen maw draws all Small creatures under the surface, possibly drowning them.

In round 3, the maw pulls all Medium or larger creatures under, possibly drowning them.

In round 4, all Large creatures are pulled under the surface of the muck, possible drowning them.

Creatures of size Huge or bigger may be trapped in the muck, but they are never in danger of slipping below the surface.

Creatures still stuck in the earthen maw at the end of round 10 are sealed in as the ground returns to solid form-however, creatures sunken into the ground do not take direct damage. Escaping from the earth, stone, forest roots, or other material requires digging or help from others, and creatures trapped this way are often easy prey.

Antipaladins sometimes combine this spell with a magical item that provides easy access to air, such as a ring of water breathing or a particular form of ioun stone. Others use this spell as an easy way to make a dramatic escape (combined with a hidden tunnel or slowly digging themselves out of the earth long after the duration ends).
