### 📜 Description
This powerful spell defends against the greatest evils, warding a location with angelic power. It acts in all ways as an angelic seal with the following exceptions: Damage suffered by an evil creature touching or entering the warded area is 20d6; evil, extraplanar creatures that fail their Fortitude saves are instantly killed, and only they make a Will save against being forced back to their home plane if they survive the Fortitude save. Only a miracle or wish can remove a greater angelic seal magically. The physical means are identical to the less powerful version of the spell.

Also, a greater angelic seal can instead be focused inward, trapping any evil creatures within the area of effect at the time of casting. Any attempts to leave the area trigger the spell's effects.
