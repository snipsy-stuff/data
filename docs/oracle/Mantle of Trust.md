### 📜 Description
You seem trustworthy and genuine to a creature that can understand what you say (you must speak to them, or they must be within range and able to overhear). Even if this target is already suspicious of you-and even if they know you are telling lies-they will (unless they successfully save, or resistant to the spell) regard you as someone to be trusted. However, if they have caught you in a lie in the previous 24 hours, they receive a +10 bonus to their Will save to resist this spell.

Mantle of trust is most often used to bypass guards, either to gain access to a restricted area or to escape a cordon or manhunt. Note that this spell affects only one target, and once it is working, you can't shift its target to others; the spell duration refers to how long the lone affected creature will trust or believe you. You always know whether your selected target has been smitten by the mantle's effect.

If you have multiple mantle of trust spells available to you, you can have one per level operating simultaneously, without strain, and you can maintain them even if you work other magic.
