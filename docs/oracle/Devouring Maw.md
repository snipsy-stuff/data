### üìú Description
You cause your mouth to fill with rotting but razor-sharp fangs granting you a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for a Medium caster; adjust bite damage as appropriate for larger or smaller casters). Your bite is treated as a magical weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Your bite also inflicts ghoul fever on a successful attack; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + the ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score) negates this disease. If the target contracts ghoul fever, additional failed saves do not accelerate the onset of the disease but instead cause the target to become sickened for 1d6 rounds; this duration stacks for multiple failed saves. The devouring maw can be used as a secondary natural weapon in conjunction with weapon attacks or as a primary natural weapon if making no other attacks.

As a full-round action, you can make a single swallowing attack with your devouring maw. This attack deals 2d6 points of damage and grants you the grab and swallow whole special attacks. A swallowed creature takes damage equal to your bite damage each round and must make a Fortitude save (DC as above) at the beginning of each round or be nauseated until the beginningof its next turn. If you swallow a creature of your size, your torso distends grotesquely and you are treated as if carrying a heavy load. Swallowing a creature on size smaller than you bloats you less severely but still causes you to be treated as if carrying a medium load. You cannot swallow additional creatures while a creature remains inside your gullet. You can regurgitate a swallowed creature as a move action, depositing them prone in an adjacent square. If you are killed while having swallowed a creature, that creature takes half as much damage as you do from the attack that dealt the killing blow.
