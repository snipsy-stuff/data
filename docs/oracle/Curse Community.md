### üìú Description
You place a powerful curse upon a single permanent settlement. The community's champion (typically its political or spiritual leader) makes the saving throw. The GM determines the community's champion and its effective borders. You choose one of the following effects:

‚Ä¢ All Craft, Knowledge, and Profession checks made within the settlement's borders automatically fail.

‚Ä¢ The settlement and all within are hidden from sight and divination, as if affected by the screen spell. Those who leave the settlement and then attempt to return are also subject to this effect.

‚Ä¢ All within the settlement suffer from a continuous modify memory effect, which causes them to forget that anything exists outside the settlement's borders.

‚Ä¢ All within the settlement's borders take a -8 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks (excluding those that automatically fail, as noted above).

You may also invent your own curse community, but it should be no more powerful than those listed above. The GM has final say on the curse's effect.

This spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a miracle or wish spell.
