### 📜 Description
The spell's area of effect floods with dangerous radiation. The strength of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as detailed below. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect (see page 55). Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The save to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell, not the standard save DC for radiation.

Caster Level              Radiation Level 
6th or lower                    Low 
7th-9th                             Medium 
10th-16th                        High 
17th or higher                Severe
