### üìú Description
Sometimes a trial reveals information best left unknown. Perhaps a village doesn't want to remember a particularly horrible murder, or the shameful act of one of its members. In this case, a powerful cleric can use steal the painful memory to remove all recollection of the event from the minds of the community. Steal the painful memory allows you to strip away all memories of a particular event. You must be able to describe the event in approximately 12 words or less. For example, any of the following would work: "Forget that Shaeryn ever existed"; "Forget that Shaeryn was murdered"; or "Forget that Prince Korrin murdered Shaeryn." The gap in memory will be filled in by the simplest solution, and all people affected by the spell will share this memory. Told to forget a murder, they will believe that the victim moved away; told to forget the identity of the murderer, they will believe that the crime was never solved or that the murderer was a stranger who escaped. 

The targets of steal the painful memory must be linked in some way. They could be members of the same community, the same guild, the same religion, or the same party of adventurers. The power of the spell spreads out in a radius from your location until it reaches the maximum range. A successful dispelling restores the memories of a single individual; it requires a limited wish, miracle or wish to restore all the memories of those affected. Touching the spell focus restores your memories as well. Destroying the spell focus restores the memories of all the affected creatures.
