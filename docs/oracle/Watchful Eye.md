### 📜 Description
In order to prepare this spell, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

This spell emulates Folgrit’s motherly protection. It functions as shield other, except as noted above, and you must maintain line of effect to the target.
