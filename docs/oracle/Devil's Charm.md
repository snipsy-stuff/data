### 📜 Description
Glib and full of guile, you suddenly become a paragon of stunning personality-though quite briefly. You gain a +6 bonus to Charisma the round after casting the spell, and this bonus declines by 1 at the start of each following round. The bonus is +5 in the next round, +4 the round after that, and so on, ending in the seventh round after casting.
