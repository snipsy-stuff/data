### üìú Description
You temporarily transform two handfuls of small items into counterfeit coins that appear to be worth up to 20 gp.

Working this magic requires a quantity of small, inorganic items to be transformed (usually pebbles, coins, tokens, or glass shards; they need not all be of the exact same size or of the same material, but they must fit in a Medium humanoid's palm). This spell also requires a relatively flat, smooth surface and your own spittle or blood.

To cast this spell, you must smear the spittle or blood across the required surface and place all the items to be transformed there. The spell's magic then turns all of the items into the semblance of gold coins. They all look alike (that is, of the same minting), are all of the same size, and ring, weigh, and handle like gold coins (if they were glass shards, they won't have cutting edges that drawn blood).

You can make the transformed "coins" bear any fanciful image and wording you can think of, and you can choose how worn or new they look. If bitten, peered at, treated with acid droplets as an alchemical assayer would, and examined closely, they seem genuine; for all intents and purposes, they are gold coins. However, if such a coin is melted, cut, or crushed, it will revert to its true material (and in damaged condition; melted, cut, or crushed). When the spell expires, fools gold coins revert to their former state.

A cleric or paladin of your own faith knows at a glance that a gold coin you have created with this spell isn't real, but others (even those familiar with this spell) won't, unless they use magical means to reveal the deception (such as detect magic or true sight).
