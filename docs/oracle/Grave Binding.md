### 📜 Description
You compel an undead creature to remain in or under the earth, and ideally in its grave or sarcophagus (if this spell is cast on a creature currently resting in its grave, mausoleum, or coffin, it suffers a -3 circumstance penalty to its saving throw). The creature can still speak, cast spells, and even attack creatures within reach, but it cannot leave the location it is bound to. If attacked, the creature is entitled to an immediate additional saving throw for each attack, with a +1 cumulative bonus for each further attack.
