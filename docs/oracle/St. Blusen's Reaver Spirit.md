### 📜 Description
You inspire your allies to fight with the commitment and savagery of berserkers. Allies in your aura gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC, similar to the rage spell. In addition, each ally has a 50% chance to deal double weapon damage. However, if they don't deal double damage, they deal no damage.

This spell cannot affect the same ally multiple times per casting, and multiple castings do not stack. During the spell's duration, it continues to affect allies that move out of range. When the spell expires, the spell effect vanishes for all allies affected, regardless of when they were first affected.
