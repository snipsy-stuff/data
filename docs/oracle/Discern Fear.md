### 📜 Description
You gain a sixth sense that allows you to intimidate creatures ease as you are able to detect what they fear. Your eyes turn red while under the effect of the spell, making it seem as though you were filled with wrath (although you can see as well as normal). While this spell is in effect, you gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on intimidate checks
