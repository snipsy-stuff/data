### 📜 Description
You shred and peel the target’s skin and outer tissues. laying bare the raw and bloody flesh, muscle, and fat layers beneath. This deals 2 points of Dexterity damage, 2 points of Constitution damage, and 2 points of Charisma damage to the target and causes 1d4 points of bleed damage. In addition, until the target’s ability damage is healed the target’s natural armor bonus to Armor Class is reduced by an amount equal to half your caster level (this bonus cannot be reduced below +0), and critical hit confirmation rolls against the target gain a +2 circumstance bonus. In addition, until this ability damage is healed, any time the target takes hit point damage from any effect, he takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from the pain. As long as he has at least 1 point of nonlethal damage, he is sickened by pain.

This spell does not affect constructs, oozes, plants, vermin, or amorphous or incorporeal creatures, nor elementals or other creatures without flesh or skin. Dermal flensing can affect undead creatures, but only fleshy undead such as ghouls, vampires, wights, and zombies. Undead do not take bleed damage or become sickened with pain. Skeletal and incorporeal undead are entirely unaffected.
