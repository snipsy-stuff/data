### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, a life-size, partially real adult dragon (of a type the same as the scale) appears, under your complete control. If, for any reason, you're unable to concentrate on controlling the actions of the spirit dragon, the illusory dragon simply ceases to move or act until you retake control. Its natural weapons and breath attack deal nonlethal damage; a successful save negates this damage. You must have seen a real dragon of the same type in order to cast this spell.
