### üìú Description
You absorb spell energy directly and convert it to raw chaotic energy, then reshape it into a magical effect. For the duration of the spell you are allowed a Will save against any spell that targets you individually (the DC is the same that the spell normally has). If the save fails, the spell affects you normally. Otherwise, you absorb the spell energy, negating the spell. On your next turn you may, as a free action, attempt to use the absorbed spell's energy to cast another spell with the chaos descriptor on your spell list. This spell must be of a spell level lower than the original spell, and must normally have a casting time of 1 standard action (though you cast it as a free action). 

You may not use metamagic feats to enhance the spell you wish to emulate. You must have any appropriate spell components. Shaping a spell from the absorbed energies does not use any of your spell slots or prepared spells, but if you fail to use the spell energy on the round after you absorb it, you take 1 point of damage per level of the spell absorbed. You can only cast one spell per round from absorbed spell energy.

Throughout the entire duration of this spell, you can absorb a total number of spell levels equal to your caster level. Spells that you absorb but do not shape count toward this limit, but spells you do not absorb do not. If a spell that targets you is of higher level than the remaining levels of absorption, the spell affects you normally, and mirror of chaos ends with no further effect.
