### 📜 Description
This spell causes tiny, grasping hands to burst from the earth to grab and harass the target. Each round, the target must make a Reflex save as a swift action or suffer a 10 ft. penalty to its base speed  minimum 0 ft.). A successful Reflex save does not end the spell but frees the target from the spell's effects for 1 round.

This spell affects other modes of movement as well, such as burrow and climb, but specifically does not affect flying and swimming. The movement slowing effect of this spell does not stack with those of similar spells, such as slow.
