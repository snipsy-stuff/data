### 📜 Description
You curse a ring, causing the next person who willingly wears it to suffer the effects of the curse.

When you cast this spell, you select any of the possible effects of bestow curse. The next creature to willingly put on the ring suffers this effect with no saving throw. The curse is discharged from the ring once it is worn. This curse can be removed from the ring or from the affected individual by any method used to remove bestow curse. A Spellcraft check (DC 25 + your caster level) identifies the item as cursed.

This effect is subject to spell resistance as soon as the ring is worn. This spell affects magical and non-magical rings, but rings that are intelligent receive a Will save.
