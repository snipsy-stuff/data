### üìú Description
An invisible shrieking vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 5 feet thick and of considerable strength. It throws any non-prone creature caught in its area of effect or that attempts to cross its area of effect 1d10 x 10 ft. directly away from the wall. Creatures who make a make a Reflex save throw themselves prone in the area of the spell. Creatures thrown in this way suffer 1d6 hit points of damage per 10 feet thrown and land prone. They also lose their grip on any handheld objects, which are blown away to the limit of the spell's range. Should the creature or object encounter a solid barrier (such as another creature, wall or door), the target deals damage to the barrier equal to the amount of damage dealt to the creature by the spell (minus its damage reduction or hardness). Should the damage be equal to or greater than the barrier's total hit points, the target bursts through the barrier and continues on its path. Flying creatures caught by this spell, or who cross through the spell's area of effect, are allowed a Reflex save to avoid being thrown to the ground. If unsuccessful, they suffer 1d6 hit points of damage per 10 ft. they are thrown when they hit the ground (the floor though a barrier suffers no damage) and are struck prone. They must make a successful fly check (DC equal to the spells DC) before they can begin flying normally.

Any ranged weapon passing through the wall are automatically deflected upward and miss (this effects even a giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons). Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures). 

While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create  cylindrical or square walls of windshear to enclose specific points.
