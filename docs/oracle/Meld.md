### 📜 Description
This spell adheres metal plates to your skin, bonding armor to you. The metal plates are the material focus of the spell and grant a +5 armor bonus and DR 5/magic. The armor bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels above 10th (to +6 at 13th level, +7 at 16th, and +8 at 19th). Due to the nature of the spell, the plates confer no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or movement reduction. When the spell expires, the armor plates simply drop off.
