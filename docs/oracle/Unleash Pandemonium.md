### 📜 Description
You call upon the wild winds of the Abyssal atmosphere, howling with the screams of damned and demented souls in torment. The area is filled with winds of windstorm strength (Core Rulebook 439), blowing in a random direction each round. Creatures within the area of effect are deafened as long as they remain within the area and for 1d4 rounds thereafter; however, they continue to hear the sounds of screams in their minds with painful intensity, causing them to become shaken for as long as they remain deafened. A successful Will save negates the shaken condition but not the deafness.
