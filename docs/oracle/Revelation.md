### üìú Description
Revelation functions as true seeing but allows you to gain additional information if you spend a full-round action studying an area or subject. Each round, you can do one of the following:

‚Ä¢ Study an area no larger than a 10-foot cube and see all secret doors hidden by any means. You also see through mundane disguises and spot creatures that are hiding.

‚Ä¢ Study a single creature or object and see all auras the creature has, including its alignment and any magical auras. You know the strength of any alignment or magical auras revealed (as detect chaos/evil/good/law and detect magic). Identifying a magic aura's school requires a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level), which you make as a free action. No magical effects short of a mind blank or the direct intervention of a deity will keep you from noting a subject's aura.

‚Ä¢ Study a single creature and know whether it is currently under a curse or any form of magical or mental control. When this spell reveals such effects, you can attempt to discern the location and identity of whatever entity laid the curse or established the control (if entity is on the same plane as you at the time you cast the spell). The entity gets a Will save to negate this effect, but if the save fails, you know its name and approximate location (as though you had used a discern location spell against a creature you have seen). If the entity has more than one name, you learn either the name by which the subject of the curse or control knows the entity, or the name the entity most commonly uses in public, as applicable.

‚Ä¢ Study a single creature and know whether it is currently capable of assuming a different form (via a special quality, magic item, or a spell available for casting) and any limitations on what those forms can be. For example, you could detect the true nature of a lycanthrope or doppelganger, or sense that the sorcerer you face knows alter self and has a 2nd-level spell slot available with which to cast it). The creature is allowed a Will save to negate this effect.

‚Ä¢ Study one creature and know whether it is living or nonliving, and whether a nonliving creature is undead or a construct. You also know the creature's condition, as though you had used detect animals or plants. 

For uses of the spell that allow it, a successful Will save makes the target creature immune to the current casting of the spell. You know that a creature has successfully saved and can attempt to study it again, but you must cast the spell again to do so. Any use of this spell that allows a Will save is blocked by a mind blank effect or the direct intervention of a deity. Under such circumstances, you know that the spell is blocked but not the source of that blocking.
