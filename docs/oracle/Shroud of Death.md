### 📜 Description
You call up a black veil of negative power that devours the living. You can draw on the life energies of all living creatures in your sight, devouring tiny bits of their spirit. You gain 1 hp in the first round, 2 hp per creature in the second round, 3 hp per creature in the third, and so forth to a maximum of 10 hp per creature. The affected creatures lose these hp on your turn as negative energy damage; if they remove themselves from your line of sight, the damage ends, but it starts again as soon as they return to your sight.

The hp you gain are temporary hp, and you can gain a maximum of 10 hp/level. Any hp above that are lost.
