### 📜 Description
This spell transforms a corporeal undead creature into a construct (animated object) that follows your commands. The undead creature loses its undead type and gains the construct type. It also loses all abilities based on negative energy (e.g. energy drain, fear aura, etc.). The construct can follow you, or remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed construct cannot be animated as undead again, though it could be resurrected.) 

For the purpose of an undead creature's special qualities, the undead creature is considered destroyed (for example: rejuvenation, gaseous form, and phylacteries). 

You cannot transform more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of ur-animate. 

The construct you create remains under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of constructs per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess constructs from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released.) Any constructs you might command by virtue of the Craft Construct feat or by control devices do not count toward this limit.
