### 📜 Description
You transform wine into the poison of your choice. The wine becomes any of the ingested poisons listed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game; you cannot transform wine into a contact, inhaled or injury poison. Thus, although you could transform wine into the equivalent of "lich dus" (save Fortitude DC 17; i 10 minutes; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive saves), you could not transform it into the equivalent of wyvern poison. The wine still tastes and smells untainted.
