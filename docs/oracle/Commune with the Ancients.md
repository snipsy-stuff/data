### 📜 Description
Through this spell, you become one with the land or ruins you are touching, gaining knowledge about your immediate surroundings regarding any occurrence that befell there during the last 48 hours. You can mentally ask up to three simple questions about the location; if your queries have clear answers, they will instantly enter your mind. Common questions include: "How many beings like me (or larger than me) usually dwell here?", "What kinds of creatures live in this forest?", "In what direction is the nearest body of water larger than a small stream (or the largest body of fresh water)?", or "Where is the closest drinkable water on the surface of the land?" 

The land replies as honestly and completely as it can, but it is incapable of answering specific questions, such as ?Does Rael Yundri live in these lands?" or "Has a wizard (or the wizard Beldran Sendaer) ever been here?" (Or, "Is Rael Yundri inside this castle or on this farm right now?") The caster can ask about specific spots or features (such as rooms or doors). Queries about a particular set of ruins will be answered about only those specific ruins. If queried about an entire land or region, the land answers about a plot of land of a 10-mile radius maximum area centered on the caster.
