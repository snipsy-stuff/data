### 📜 Description
You radiate a magical aura that damages all creatures of any three creature types (that you choose at the time of casting) that come within 30 feet of you. These creatures take 3d6 points of damage every round they stay within your radius of effect. Additionally, at the time of casting, you choose one of those three types. All creatures of that type must make a second Will save to remain within the radius after taking damage; anyone failing this second Will save is immediately forced out of the radius. (This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks and the target chooses the path; the speed of the target isn't taken into consideration - the spell moves the target to the outer edge of the spell's radius.)
