### 📜 Description
You channel a fragment of the energy of an exploding sun into your blow. This has the effect of dealing an additional 1d8 hp fire damage for every two levels. This fire damage is not multiplied with the critical hit, but it stacks with any other fire damage dealt by the weapon, no matter if it is from another spell or a weapon special ability. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hp by the target weapon's attack while channeling this energy is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of ash, but these ashes can still be affected by spells such as raise dead. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.

If this spell is channeled through the attack of a nonmagical weapon, the weapon is automatically disintegrated as soon as the attack is resolved.
