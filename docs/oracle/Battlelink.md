### 📜 Description
You create a mental link between yourself and several allies (all of which must have Intelligence scores of 3 or higher), allowing the whole group to form a kind of mass mind that allows them to coordinate actions in combat. Once the battlelink is established, no creature in the linked grouped can be flanked or surprised unless all creatures are flanked or surprised. Whenever two or more creatures in the group threaten the same foe, all receive a +2 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls against that foe and a +2 circumstance bonus to Armor Class against that foe's melee attacks. Likewise, whenever two or more creatures in the link are within 5 feet of each other, they receive a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Reflex saves.
