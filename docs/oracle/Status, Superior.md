### 📜 Description
When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, superior status allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded (as a standard action you can learn the percentage of wounds/hp total), any special condition, extraordinary, supernatural, spell or spellability affecting them. As a move action you can see and hear through the eyes and listen through the ears of a single creature affected by this superior status. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distances between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it. 

You can also cast a limited selection of spells through the link, as if you were touching the target. You can cast any non-personal divination spell, and any spell that meets the following conditions:

Level: 0, 1st, 2nd or 3rd Range: Touch or Close Target: Creature touched or one creature Saving Throw: harmless

For example, if you become aware (through the superior status spell) that one of your linked companions is dying, you can cast cure moderate wounds to try to revive her.
