### 📜 Description
This spell causes force effects to slide harmlessly off of the recipient by manipulating imperceptible counterharmonic tendrils of anti-force that are momentarily revealed by their collision with the force effect. This provides spell resistance of 12 + your caster level against effects with the force descriptor as well as against disintegrate, repulsion, or telekinesis. Even if such effects overcome this protection, this spell provides a +2 bonus to saving throws, AC, and CMD against such effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 10th level and +6 at 15th level.
