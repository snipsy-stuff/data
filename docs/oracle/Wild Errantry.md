### üìú Description
You gain divine aid for a single intended action, chosen after casting and attempted before the spell expires. Wild errantry allows two rolls to be made, both with a +4 luck bonus, to any required skill checks see if a crazy, daring, or unlikely action can be successfully attempted. Typical actions include leaping across a chasm and through a small opening, jumping from the back of one racing mount to another, or falling some distance and successfully catching hold of (and managing to cling to) a railing, windowsill, swinging rope, or other handhold.

This magic smiles upon farfetched and even foolhardy actions. If used to aid a relatively straightforward act (swinging across a river on a vine, for example, as opposed to leaping to catch that vine to make the same swinging journey), its benefit decreases to a +3 luck bonus. Wild errantry also benefits actions of chance, such as rolling a particular result with dice (in game), finding something hidden (for example, under shells), or drawing a particular card. If a game of chance has been fixed to be impossible (a selection of cards has been altered, dice are "crooked," or there's no hidden  marker under any shell), this magic tells its caster that.
