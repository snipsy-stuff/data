### 📜 Description
Tan hide treats the target as if a trained tanner has cured it over a period of days. Each casting cures up to 15 lbs. of skin or hide into leather of quality sufficient for creating items with the Craft (leather) Skill. The skin or hide must be freshly slaughtered (no less than 1 day old), and cut into pieces no more than 15 lbs. in weight (the uncured hide of an adult dragon typically weighs about 50 lbs, for example, meaning it would need to be cut into four pieces for four separate castings). If the target is any heavier or older, and the casting fails.
