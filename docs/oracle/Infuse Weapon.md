### 📜 Description
Choose an energy type when you cast the spell (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic); the spell gains this energy descriptor. Infuse weapon gives the touched weapon a +1 bonus of the chosen energy type on damage rolls. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (though a monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell).
