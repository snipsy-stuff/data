### üìú Description
In order to prepare this spell, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

This spell increases the effectiveness of a planned action. If the targets spend at least 1 minute studying a situation, they receive bonuses to their first actions in response to the situation. All targets must declare in advance what their intended actions are. If they perform those actions, they receive a +2 sacred bonus to AC, saving throws, and checks for the first round. This bonus increases to +4 at 10th level and +6 at 15th level.

For example, the PCs discover a camp of orcs; the PC cleric casts tactical assault, the group spends 1 minute analyzing the layout of the camp, and then declares its actions. As long as the PCs stick to the plan, they gain a +2 morale bonus to AC, saving throws, and all actions for the first round.
