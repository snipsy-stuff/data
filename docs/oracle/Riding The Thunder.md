### 📜 Description
The target(s) of the spell, which may include the spellcaster, as well as all their equipment carried become as gaseous and translucent as the air itself. An affected creature can move in any direction, even up or down, at four times its normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through porous objects at half speed. Sight and hearing are limited to 120 ft.

For the duration of the spell, affected creatures gain a +8 on all Stealth rolls and gain a +4 enhancement bonus on AC. They cannot cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or make physical attacks. They can use supernatural and extraordinary abilities as long as they do not have to move or touch any objects or creatures to use them.

If you end the spell and rematerialize while inside a material object (such as a wall), you appear at to the nearest open space and take 1d6 hp damage per 5 ft. that you travel.
