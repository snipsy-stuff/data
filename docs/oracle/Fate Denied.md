### 📜 Description
With a single touch, you align the fates against the target. That target suffers a -1 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action after the target has made an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw, forcing the target to reroll that attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. When it does so, the target takes a -4 penalty instead of a -1 penalty. The target must be in your line of sight for you to dismiss this spell.
