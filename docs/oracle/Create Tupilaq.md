### 📜 Description
This infamous grudge magic spell creates a tupilaq (see Pathfinder Bestiary 3), which is a construct used to track and kill a hated enemy who is usually a rival spellcaster. The spell captures a hungry spirit to animate the construct.

This spell requires the caster to construct a body for his tupilaq. This takes nine consecutive nights, built from the body parts of recently dead animals and children wrapped in seaweed or vines, and a bony outer shell treated with icy unguents and sealing salves worth 20,000 gp. The construct remains inanimate until the creator inserts an idol in the shape of your rival to serve as its heart. The verbal component is a long, ancient song of revenge, sung over the construct's body each night.
