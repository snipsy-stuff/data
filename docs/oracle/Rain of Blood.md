### 📜 Description
The rain of blood is one of the most terrible plagues. Spread over an area, it pollutes the countryside, changing fertile land to barren, and poisoning crops, water supplies (requiring purify food and drink to remedy) and those caught in the downpour. Those who are caught in the downpour suffer a -4 morale penalty to all saves and skill checks that lasts for the duration of the rain and for 4d12 hours afterward (this penalty is applied to the save against the poisonous downpour). Drinking the water has the same effect as being caught in the downpour. Crops and water fully shielded from the rain are immune to this effect, but the smallest drop will pollute it.

Poison (Ex) Contact; save DC as spell; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
