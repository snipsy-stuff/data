### 📜 Description
You channel a fraction of the tumultuous ecosystem of the Hao Jin Tapestry and redirect it through your hands as a beam of deteriorating energy. You can fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and can target only a construct or an object. If a ray hits, the target begins to crumble, taking 2d6 points of damage. This damage ignores hardness and damage reduction.
