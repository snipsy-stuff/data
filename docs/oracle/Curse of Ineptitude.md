### 📜 Description
You cut off a creature from all knowledge of its gifts and abilities. The subject's Base Attack Bonus changes to a poor progression (as a sorcerer), Base Saves change to a poor progression (as a construct). The subject is no longer proficient with any armor or weapon, gains no benefits from any of its feats, and none of its skills are considered class skills. It also loses the benefit of any extraordinary abilities (such as a rogue's sneak attack) it possess, though it retains its supernatural, spell and spell-like abilities. If you wield or are considered to be attending an item that is subject to this spell you are automatically subject to this spell so long as you are attending the item (some items bear an additional curse such that they cannot be removed or dropped).

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. A remove curse grants a second saving throw but if this save is unsuccessful the spell has no further effect.
