### 📜 Description
This spell grants flaming to all weapons held by you and your allies at the time of casting for the duration of the spell. These weapons deal an extra 1d6 hp fire damage. Missile weapons affected by this spell bestow the fire energy on their ammunition.

If a weapon affected by this spell is set down, sheathed, dropped, disarmed, given away, or otherwise lost, the spell effect ends for that weapon. A weapon that already has the flaming special ability gains no benefit from this spell. An ally with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat wielding two weapons gains the spell's benefit on both weapons. An ally without the feat wielding two weapons gains this benefit only once and must choose which weapon is affected.
