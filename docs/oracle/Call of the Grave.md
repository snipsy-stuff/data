### 📜 Description
This charm makes a target creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly), and the creature moves toward you even if the terrain is threatened, difficult, or otherwise dangerous (such as magma or a pit). The creatures continue to move toward you on following rounds if you maintain concentration. If you or your allies attack the creatures, however, they gain a +5 bonus on their saving throws.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed creatures as if they were automatons, but they always consider your words and actions in the most favorable light. You can attempt to give orders or instructions, but you must succeed on an opposed Charisma check. (Retries are not allowed.) Foolhardy or dangerous suggestions are followed; suicidal directions are always ignored.
