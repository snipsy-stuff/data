### 📜 Description
This spell lays an arcane trap on another spellcaster. The next time the affected spellcaster targets another creature with a spell or casts an area-of-effect spell that causes hp damage, this spell trap triggers and their own spell affects them instead of their intended target unless they succeed on a Will save.

}For an area-of-effect spell, the area is centered on the affected caster. If the target casts spells that do not do damage, those spells are not affected by the spell trap.

This spell affects spells of 4th level or lower. If the affected spellcaster casts a higher level spell that otherwise fit the criteria, spell trap remains untriggered.
