### 📜 Description
Dim creates an aura that hampers normal, nonmagical light sources. The spell must be cast upon an object, which then radiates the dimming aura. All light sources within a 100-ft. radius cast only half as much light as they normally would, reducing both the normal and shadowy light radius cast by the source by one half. This spell has no effect on magical light sources of any level. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.

A spell with the light descriptor of any level counters and dispels this spell.
