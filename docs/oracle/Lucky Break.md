### üìú Description
One of the next failed rolls made by one of the targets of the spell becomes a success. The gods of luck, rather than the caster, choose which type of roll is transformed.

When determining which type of roll is affected, the GM should roll a d10 and consult the following table
Table 2-8: Rolls Affected
 D10       Roll transformed
1-2       Saving throw
3-5       Skill check
6-10      Attack roll

The GM also should roll 1d4 to determine which roll is improved among those that immediately follow the casting of the spell. A roll of 1 means the very next failed roll of the indicated type is improved, while a roll of 4 means that three rolls fail before one is changed. The subjects cannot be under the effect of more than one lucky break spell at a time.
