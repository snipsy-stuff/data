### 📜 Description
A fortified hoard acts as an advanced alarm spell. A hoard fortification lasts longer and covers a larger area than alarm. Furthermore, you can choose have another creature notified that the alarm has been triggered rather than yourself, whether or not the alarm is audible. The creature must be selected at the time of casting and must remain within 2 miles of the spell to receive the mental notice.
