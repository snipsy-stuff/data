### 📜 Description
You unleash a surge of emotion that cows your enemies and simultaneously inspires your allies with your awesome power. Living enemies within the area are affected as fear. Living allies gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls and saving throws against emotion and fear effects. In addition, any ally currently affected by an emotion or fear effect gains a new saving throw to break the effect. This has no effect if the original effect did not allow a saving throw.
