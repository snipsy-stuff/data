### 📜 Description
Upon completing this spell, a short pillar of stone and earth abruptly rises 5 ft. from the ground in the target area. The 3-ft. diameter column has hardness 8, 300 hp, and break DC 25. The pillar does not fill the entire space, and so it does not block movement, but it does count as difficult terrain.

The pillar grants cover to a Medium or smaller creature in its square. A Medium or smaller creature in the square when the pillar rises must make a Reflex save to avoid being suddenly shoved upward with the force of the pillar. Those that fail are knocked prone in the square and carried up 5 feet on top of the pillar. A creature may choose to remain on the pillar deliberately.
