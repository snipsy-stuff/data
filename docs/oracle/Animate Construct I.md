### üìú Description
This spell animates an object or a carefully prepared construct. The object acts immediately, on your turn, and may attack your opponents to the best of its ability. You can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions as a move action. You choose the object to animate, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.

If you wish, you may animate a prepared construct rather than a mass of metal or stone. This requires preparing a carefully crafted form. The cost of this form is half the usual gp cost of building such a construct, for it is not animated permanently. In this case, the duration is 1 hr,/level outside of combat and 1 round/level during combat, and the spell animates one of the creatures from the animated constructs list (see below).

With this spell, a caster may animate no more than twice his level in hit dice of constructs; animating more simply means that a previously animated construct becomes immobile and lifeless. A construct destroyed in combat cannot be reanimated until a repair metal spell is cast on it, or (in the case of stone or wood) until it has been rebuilt at the same cost as the original construction.

In the below table, for entries with a (2) after them, two creatures of that type are animated by the spell. The table contains superscripts as follows: AB for Green Ronin's Advanced Bestiary, B2 for Paizo's Pathfinder Bestiary 2, B3 for Paizo's Pathfinder Bestiary 3, TOH for Frog God Games's Tome of Horrors, and MB for Midgard Bestiary for Pathfinder RPG. Entries without superscripts are from Pathfinder Bestiary.
