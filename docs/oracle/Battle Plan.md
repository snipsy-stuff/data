### üìú Description
You assess battlefield conditions and general enemy tactics after completing this spell, improving your decisions about a battle, which you specify when casting this spell. Every ally with you during the spell's casting or to whom you directly communicate the spell's information gains a +2 morale bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saves, and skill checks related to the battle. If these characters disseminate the information (a process that should take a period of time as determined by the GM), the spell grants a +1 morale bonus to characters who receive the secondhand information. No more than 10 characters/caster level can receive this bonus, though.

Unexpected events may interfere with your reading of the future. You have a 75% chance +1% per caster level (maximum 95%) to successfully predict an upcoming battle's initial elements (such as whether the enemy will attack directly or with an ambush, whether the enemy will call reinforcements, etc); the roll is made secretly. For each hour the battle continues, make a new roll. If the roll fails, all bonuses provided by this spell revert to penalties due to the battle's chaos for the next hour; additionally, the chance of future accurate predictions drops by 10% per hour.
