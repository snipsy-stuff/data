### 📜 Description
The recipient of this spell can find the closest large mass of metal or gems with a volume of 5 cubic ft. or greater. The recipient can find the material outside, indoors, or underground within the spell's range. Though used most often to locate treasure hoards, the spell sometimes locates raw material such as unmined metal, unrefined or refined gems, or worked material primarily composed of one substance, such as piles of gold coins or a large iron cauldron. Unlike locate object, lead does not block the spell. Lead can even be the material sought, although magical effects that block divinations work normally.
