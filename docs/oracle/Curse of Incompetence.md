### 📜 Description
With a mocking set of gestures, you leave the target incapable of performing at, or even near its best. For the spell's duration, the target takes a -6 penalty on all skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

Additionally, if the target gives directions or orders to other creatures, those creatures incur a -3 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks related to these orders.
