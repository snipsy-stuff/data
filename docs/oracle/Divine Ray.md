### 📜 Description
You release a powerful channel of concentrated divine energy from either your eyes or open palm that deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) if you succeed at a ranged touch attack against your target. The energy unleashed by this spell is divine in nature and most normal energy resistances and immunities do not protect against it, unless specifically noted.
