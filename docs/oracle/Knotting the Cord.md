### 📜 Description
This is a death spell that slowly strangles the target. The target must be within range when the spell is cast, but the distance between the target and the spellcaster does not matter after the spell has been cast. The caster ties several tight knots on a rope in hatred, and then hides the knotted rope, typically by burying it in the earth. The knotted rope may not be moved after it has been hidden; doing so breaks the spell. The target suffers 1 unhealable point of permanent Constitution drain per day until he is dead. The target gets a new saving throw each day. With a successful Fortitude saving throw, no drain is suffered that day, but the spell can only be broken and the Constitution drain healed by finding the rope and untying the knots. 

Once per day, the target can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC equal to the spell's DC). With a successful check, the target senses the direction in which the knotted rope is hidden.
