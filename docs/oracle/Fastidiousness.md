### 📜 Description
While protected by fastidiousness, your person and your equipment stay clean and dry. Dust and moisture slough off immediately; even when you are completely soiled, your appearance reverts to a pristine state over the course of 1 minute. While this spell offers no protection against most attacks, staying constantly sanitary grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against inhaled and ingested diseases.

Members of the Prophet of Kalistrade prestige class (Paths of Prestige 42) can cast this spell, even though it is not a divination or enchantment.
