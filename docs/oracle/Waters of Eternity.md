### 📜 Description
Worshipers of deities that hold water sacred use waters of eternity to gain a look into the future.

Staring into a bowl of saltwater grants the spellcaster 1d6 brief, soundless visions of the near future. If saltwater is used, the spell grants visions of what is likely to happen within the next 72 hours If seawater was scooped into the bowl directly from the sea within the last hour, the caster can see 2d4 visions that go up to one week into the future. Each vision is usually vague and lasts less than five seconds.
