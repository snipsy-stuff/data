### 📜 Description
This spell causes an object to become much harder to destroy than it normally would be. The object's hardness increases by 20 and it gains 40 hit points per inch of thickness (these increases do not stack with other magic effects that increase hardness or hit points). The object also repairs itself as though it had fast healing 10. If the object already has a greater hardness, hit points, or fast healing than this spell grants, then it keeps the higher amount, but gains no additional bonus. While virtually indestructible makes an object harder than adamantine, it does not count as adamantine for damage reduction, or any other purpose.
