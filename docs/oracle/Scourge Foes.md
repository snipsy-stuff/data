### 📜 Description
You channel a blast of divine energy that explodes with a thunderclap and leaves foes reeling. Creatures and objects in the spell's area of effect take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8). Half this damage is sonic, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to sonic attacks. Living creatures in the area are treated as staggered for 1 round and are deafened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half and negates the deafness and staggered effects.
