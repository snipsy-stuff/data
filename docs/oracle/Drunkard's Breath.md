### 📜 Description
This spell emanates from your mouth and functions like stinking cloud, except as noted above. The effect is barely visible and does not obscure vision. The nausea effect resembles that of an extreme hangover. This is a poison effect. Cayden Cailean's church uses this spell to disperse angry crowds, such as when celebrations get out of hand.
