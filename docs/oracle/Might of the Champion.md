### 📜 Description
You or one touched creature temporarily gain +5 Strength (gaining the relevant attack and damage benefits). Your armor and weapons are rendered unbreakable while the might of the champion is upon you, and so you can deliver attacks that cleave stone or massive metal chains or gates, shatter the armor of a foe, and achieve other results that would normally defeat you-your attacks against objects ignore hardness and deliver critical hit damage.

A particular being can only benefit from might of the champion once every 48 hours If a second might of the champion is cast on the same individual within 48 hours of the expiration of a previous one, its magic dissipates without effect.
