### 📜 Description
You open a portion of your spirit to possession by the soul of a dead rogue. You gain proficiency with all simple weapons and deal +1d6 points of sneak attack damage per three caster levels when striking a target which you flank, or which is denied dodge bonuses to Armor Class. You remain lucid and able to choose your actions, but the strain of sharing your mind with another spirit is taxing; you suffer 1d4+1 points of temporary ability damage to your spellcasting key ability score. A Will save reduces this to half.
