### üìú Description
Infamous for its use among feuding wizards and witches, this spell lets you steal one or more prepared spells from the target. With a melee touch attack, you transfer one or more spells from the target to yourself.

Roll a 1d6: The result equals the level of the spell or spells transferred. If the victim does not have a spell of that level, you receive one of its highest level spells and an additional spell of the roll's remainder. You may cast stolen spells once using this spell's effects.

For instance, if you roll a five and the target's highest spell level is 3rd-level, then you receive a 3rd-level spell and a 2nd-level spell. You can steal from either an arcane or divine spell slot and from either a caster who prepares spells or casts them spontaneously. If you steal from a spontaneous caster, treat it as if it had expended a spell of the stolen one's level. If no spell of the appropriate level is currently prepared or if a spontaneous caster has no more spells of that level available, this spell has no effect.

The theft deals the target 1 hp of damage per level of the spell or spells stolen. Normally you steal spells at random, but if you desire you may steal a particular spell you suspect the caster has prepared or available. In this case, if successful you receive only the target spell if the caster has it prepared or available. If not, this spell fails.

You may cast the stolen spell as normal, but the transferred magic functions as if cast by the target, not you, and you may not apply metamagic feats to it. You automatically receive knowledge of any verbal and somatic components required. You do not retain this information, however, after the stolen spell is cast.

You do not need material components to cast a stolen spell if they are worth 1 gp or less, but you must supply any more expensive. The target may not prepare spells using the stolen slot or slots and loses an appropriate spontaneous slot until they receive a break enchantment, dispel magic, or remove curse.These all removes the spell from the thief as well, if it has not been cast. If the victim is a prepared caster, it may prepare the same spell using a different slot.
