### üìú Description
Multiple balls of fiery energy swirl around you and, at your command, smash against one creature or object within range. You may conjure up to three balls plus one additional ball for every two levels beyond seventh (to a maximum of six balls at 13th level). Each ball swirls closely to the targeted creature or object, always staying within 2 ft. of one another (they always stay in the same square). You can move the balls as a move action anywhere within the spell's range. These balls serve three functions.

First, the balls provide normal light in a 20-ft. radius, increasing the light level for an additional 20 ft. by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright light, this effect does not occur.

Second, this spell provides flanking on the target to all allies of the caster for as long as the balls are adjacent to the target;

Finally, the caster may direct one or more balls to collide with a target. Each ball used in this fashion requires a range touch attack to hit. Each hit deals 2d6 hp fire damage and causes the colliding balls to dissipate. A miss with a ball does not cause it to dissipate.

A caster may have only one instance of this spell active at a time.
