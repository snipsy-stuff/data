### üìú Description
With this powerful spell the spellcaster can quietly and subtly control the thoughts of others. The caster must have a personal object or piece of the target (such as clothing, hair, fingernail clippings, etc.) with which to channel the spell. In addition, the caster must remain within the range for the duration of the casting. At the beginning of the enchantment, the caster names the target and from then on, uses the second person to refer to the target, as if talking directly to the target. The target begins to hear incessant, unintelligible whispering that wears down his defenses. Nothing stops the whispering, not even a silence spell, because the effect is in the target's mind. Mind blank stops the effects of the spell, but not the bother of the whispering. During the casting, the cleric must specify how the target will be affected:

Emotions: There are five emotions that the spell can create: fear, anger, peace, hate and love.

‚Ä¢ Fear: The target feels an overriding sense of fear and dread. This fear cannot be defined and is not specific to any one thing; however, it wears away at the target, causing a -3 morale penalty to all skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

‚Ä¢ Anger: An intense sense of rage and anger invades the thoughts of the target. He is liable to lash out at friends and foes alike. Those things that are normally just slight irritants become enormous obstacles. This rage of emotion interferes with logical thought. NPCs who are angered have an unfriendly attitude. The best reaction such an NPC can have is indifferent. In addition, anger clouds judgment, imposing a -2 morale penalty to all skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

‚Ä¢ Peace: The target feels a sense of calm and peace. While in this state, he is unable to initiate aggressive action. The attitude of an affected NPC will begin with indifferent, and any character who behaves positively toward the NPC receives a +5 bonus to determine the new attitude. However, while under the influence of the spell, the target is reluctant to attack anyone, even if defending herself. The target suffers a -2 morale penalty to attack and damage rolls while thus affected.

‚Ä¢ Hate: The target is filled with antipathy toward the world in general and anyone who dares cross his path. This consuming hatred can cloud his decision making ability. His initial NPC attitude toward others begins as unfriendly, and all attempts to influence him suffer a -5 penalty for the duration of the spell. In addition, hatred interferes with logical decision making, imposing a -2 morale penalty to all skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

‚Ä¢ Love: Friendship and love dominate the mind of the target. While she will be more amenable and friendly, the love of others can interfere with daily decision making. The initial NPC attitude toward others begins as friendly, and any character who behaves in a positive manner receives a +5 bonus to reaction rolls. Those she considers friends are to be guarded and protected. If any attack her friends, the target receives a +3 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls to defend them. However, if those the target considers friends attack her, she gets a -2 morale penalty to attack and damage rolls against her friends.

Emotions last as long as the caster can remain within earshot of the target and maintain her concentration. Once the casting ends, the spell effects remain for 1 round/level of spell caster.

Decisions: If the cleric chooses to affect the target's decisions, he can alter what the target has already been thinking, but cannot plant completely new ideas in the target's mind. For example, if a kindly lord was considering trade negotiations with a neighboring city, the caster could guide the lord to accept or reject the offer. However, the target cannot be forced into doing something completely against her morals. In the example above, the caster could not cause the kindly lord to abandon all negotiations and kill the ambassadors.
