### 📜 Description
This spell causes one minotaur to fly into a frothing rage. The target gains a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC. In addition, whenever the target makes a charge attack, it receives a +4 bonus on the attack roll (instead of the usual +2). While under the effects of this spell, the minotaur does not fall unconscious while below 0 hp, but it does continue to lose one hp every round it takes a standard or full-round action.
