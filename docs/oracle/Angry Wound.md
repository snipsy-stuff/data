### 📜 Description
Upon concluding the dreadful incantation, you become fueled with awful power; your touch causes flesh to burst and weep freely. With a touch, you open an ugly wound on a living creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage (no save). Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage as its flesh bursts and suppurates. If the target succeeds on two consecutive saves, the effect ends.
