### üìú Description
You channel divine energy into your own shed blood, transforming and expanding the drops of blood into a group of warriors. You can create one creature for every four levels (so, a 20th level cleric could spawn five of these creatures). Each blood protector created costs one hit point's worth of shed blood. Blood protectors appear humanoid but have no distinct features; their bodies are clearly composed of fresh blood, somehow held together in largely solid form. The warriors appear to have armor molded to them, and each one wields a shield and either a spear or short sword (your choice) with a +5 enhancement bonus. These warriors count as constructs. They do not have names, personalities, or any sense of self, but can follow simple orders. After the spell fades, or if they are destroyed, they revert to drops of blood.
