### 📜 Description
A shower of magic-aligned arrows rains down on the area, dealing 1d6 points of magical, aligned, piercing damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Spellcasters may modify the alignment of hail of arrows to bypass certain kinds of damage reduction. Creatures with damage reduction 5 or greater that is not overcome by magic, piercing, and/or the chosen alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or law) damage are immune to this effect. Aligning the damage requires the spellcaster to have that alignment component and makes the spell carry that descriptor, respectively.
