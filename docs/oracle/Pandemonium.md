### 📜 Description
A roaring multicolored light appears in the area, a bizarre conglomeration of destructive energy crashing through it. Any creature within the area takes 5d6 points of damage each round, and non-chaotic creatures are blinded (Will save halves the damage and negates the blindness). Roll each round to determine the energy type dealt (1d6: 1-acid, 2-cold, 3-electricity, 4-fire, 5-sonic, 6-force damage). 

All attacks in the area have a 50% chance of missing and a 50% chance of automatically hitting; Missile attacks that miss have an additional 50% chance of being redirected to hit the attacker. While in the area, each creature may use a move action to teleport to any other location within the area of effect; immediately after teleporting, the creature has a 50% chance to then be teleported back to the previous position. Every spell cast within the radius has a 50% chance of causing a mishap (as a scroll mishap).
