### 📜 Description
In order to prepare this spell, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

This spell enhances your spells that bring the dead back to life. If you cast raise dead, the target creature is restored to full hit points. If you cast breath of life, that spell can revive a dead target as long as you cast it within a number of rounds equal to half your caster level, and the healing effect is treated as if the spell were empowered with the Empower Spell feat. Casting any of these spells discharges the invigorating repose spell.
