### 📜 Description
You channel a blast of divine energy that explodes with a thunderclap and leaves foes reeling. Creatures and objects in the spell's area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 20d6). Half this damage is sonic, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to sonic attacks. Living creatures in the area are treated as stunned for 1 round and are permanently deafened. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half and leaves the target staggered and deafened for 1 round but the subject is immune to the secondary staggered and deafness affects resulting from subsequent castings of this spell by the same caster for 24 hours.
