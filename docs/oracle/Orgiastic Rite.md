### 📜 Description
You incite the passions, compelling the targets to engage in a frenzy of carnality. This functions as unnatural lust, but affected creatures are attracted to the nearest creature rather than a specific creature designated by the caster. If the nearest creature is also affected by the spell both creatures drop prone.

Affected creatures immediately drop any held objects, and if wearing any magical or mundane items in the belt, body, chest, or head slots, they remove one random item per round and drop the item on the ground in their square. An affected creature wearing armor spends the first round of the spell’s effect removing portions of their armor before doffing any other worn items; thereafter, treat their armor as if donned hastily, worsening their armor bonus and armor check penalty by 1 until they spend 1 minute putting their armor back together.

All targets of the spell must be of the same type, though they may have different subtypes. Each round after the first round of the spell’s effect, affected creatures can attempt a new Will save to break free of the compulsion and end the effect. Once the spell ends, affected creatures are fatigued (Fortitude negates).
