### 📜 Description
This spell functions like lesser geas, but it binds the target more closely to you, allowing you to channel a portion of your patron’s eldritch powers into the creature you have enslaved. You may choose to grant the target a +2 profane bonus to one ability score, or a +1 profane bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. If the target is a spellcaster or has spell-like abilities, you can instead increase their effective caster level by 1 for determining the effect of their spells or spell-like abilities; this does not increase the number or level of spells available to the target. Being the target of this spell strains the target’s mind, causing it to gain 1 Madness point and to take a -2 penalty to saving throws against any mind-affecting effect you use.

You cannot cast lesser powerslave on the same creature again unless the previous spell has ended. A creature can, however, be targeted with this spell simultaneously by different casters, but each caster must choose a different benefit as they do not stack. Placing multiple lesser powerslave spells in effect simultaneously on the same creature also increases the chance that the target may be unable to simultaneously fulfill each underlying lesser geas, triggering the usual ill effects.

At the GM’s option, this spell can be used by cultists of archdevils, demon lords, and similar evil powers.
