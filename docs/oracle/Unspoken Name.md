### 📜 Description
Prized among those who seek to monitor the attention paid to them, this spell is said to be used by Arazni to identify those followers who dare refer to her as “the Harlot Queen” so she might summarily dismiss them. When you cast this spell, designate a word, phrase, or name. If a creature within 1 mile of you uses that word, phrase, or name to refer to you, you immediately learn that creature’s name, appearance, and location. This discharges the spell.
