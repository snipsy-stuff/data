### 📜 Description
This spell functions as flesh puppet, but can animate multiple zombies. As noted in animate dead, you can’t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie’s string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn’t end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a flesh puppet requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round.

Unlike with flesh puppet, you can command a zombie to attack. If you do, all your zombies immediately gain the staggered quality and no longer appear to be alive.

This spell ends automatically if you cast flesh puppet or flesh puppet horde on a new corpse.
