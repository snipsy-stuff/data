### 📜 Description
Your touch grants you one of the target's senses, auras, movement modes, feats, languages, immunities, or extraordinary abilities. The target retains the stolen ability, as well. You may also target a fresh corpse (dead no more than 1 minute), which receives no save. You may not possess more than one stolen power at a time.
