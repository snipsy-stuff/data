### 📜 Description
You may, through the use of this spell, take two pieces of metal and touch them together so that they are instantly united together seamlessly. If one of the metal objects being melded is being held by a person opposed to the action, such as a fighter holding a sword, that person can attempt to negate the spell with a Will save.
