### 📜 Description
The magical darkness conjured by this spell is often used by evil clerics to heal undead minions. A cloud of inky darkness billows out from the point you designate. The darkness completely obscures all sight, including darkvision. A creature within the cloud is considered to have full concealment; attacks suffer a 50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target. 

Solid darkness is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at one-tenth normal speed (minimum of 5 feet per round, though you cannot take a 5 foot step), and all melee attack and melee damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The darkness prevents effective ranged weapon attacks, except for magic rays and the like. A creature or object that falls into solid darkness is slowed, so that each 10 feet of darkness that the creature or object falls through reduces the damage of a fall by 1d6 points, with a minimum damage of 0. For example, if a creature falls 30 feet, then passes through 20 feet of solid darkness before striking the ground, the total damage of the fall is 5d6 - 2d6 (total fall of 50 feet, with 20 feet of the fall being through solid darkness). 

Solid darkness is charged with negative energy; any creature within it suffers 1 point of negative energy damage each round (no save). Undead or other negative-energy creatures within the darkness are instead healed 1 hit point per round.
