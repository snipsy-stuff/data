### 📜 Description
You create an aura around yourself or a touched creature that moves as you move, and it becomes visible only in momentary silver flashes as it thwarts attacks. A weaponthwart protects only against physical attacks from both magical and normal slashing and piercing pointed weapons. It rebounds all such attacks back at the weapon wielders for full damage.

A weaponthwart will turn back a weapon animated or guided by magic, but it won't block weapons or weapon-like forces created by a spell (such as the whirling blades of a blade barrier). Nor will it block bludgeoning weapons, the blows of armored fists, or the damage of spikes on the armor of a foe crashing into someone protected by a weaponthwart. Edged and pointed missiles are flung back at their sources, as are spike-studded balls and hurled caltrops. Blunt bludgeoning missiles such as boulders are unimpeded by this spell.
