### 📜 Description
This spell functions as devouring maw, dealing 1d8 points of damage for a Medium caster, but the ghoul fever conferred by your bite attack takes effect immediately, as the contagion spell. Your swallowing attack deals 2d8 points of damage and you can perform it as a standard action. If you choose to perform your swallowing attack as a full-round action, it deals 4d6 points of damage and you may use the fast swallow special attack at any point prior to the end of your turn. If a humanoid creature dies while swallowed in your greater devouring maw, it is immediately transformed into a ghoul or ghast, as if it had died of ghoul fever. You may regurgitate this creature as a move action. It remains under your control for 1 round per level, after which it becomes uncontrolled, though a ghoul or ghast you create with this spell never attacks you unless you attack it first.
