### 📜 Description
You commune with dark spirits to conjure an image of a particularly terrifying fiend, and then you send it hurtling toward a foe. Unless it succeeds at a Will save, the foe believes it has incurred the fiend's wrath and flees or freezes with fright

If the target fails its save, it believes the image is real. The target then must make a Reflex save. If the Reflex save fails, the target takes 3d6 hp of damage and is stunned for 1d3 rounds. If the save succeeds, it is frightened. This effect lasts as long as it takes the creature to flee the encounter or until it dies in combat.

This spell is most commonly found among the tieflings, and rarely seen elsewhere. Some believe that a human caster who casts this spell more than once becomes a tiefling himself.
