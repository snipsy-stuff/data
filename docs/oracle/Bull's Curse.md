### 📜 Description
You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Strength; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, bull's strength, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.

Bull's curse counters bull's strength.
