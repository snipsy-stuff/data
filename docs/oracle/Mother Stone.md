### 📜 Description
You connect to the roots of the earth, becoming immobile but empowered with elemental earthen protection. You gain a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, DR 5/slashing, and a +10 bonus on Strength checks to avoid being bull rushed and on Dexterity checks to avoid being tripped. On the other hand, all of your move speeds become zero. If you are moved (through teleportation or a successful bull rush attempt, for example) the spell ends.
