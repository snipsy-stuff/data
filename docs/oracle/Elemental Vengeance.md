### 📜 Description
You are surrounded by thin, crackling streaks of acid, cold, electricity, and fire energy. You gain resistance 5 to each of these energy types. If an attack or spell drops you below 0 hp during this spell's duration and the attacker who caused that damage is within 100 ft., the energy surrounding you immediately strikes that creature and it takes 2d6 hp damage.

This damage's energy type is the same as the last attack to which you applied energy damage resistance. If a creature would take damage in this way and you have not applied energy resistance to any attacks, roll a d4 to determine this damage's type: A 1 means acid damage, a 2 means cold damage, a 3 means electricity damage, and a 4 means fire damage. Spell resistance applies to this damage.
