### 📜 Description
This spell heals hp equal to 1d6 + your level (maximum +10 hp) to a creature that was damaged during this round. If the damage the target took would reduce it to lower than 0 hp, and the damage healed by this spell brings it to 0 or more hp, the target does not fall unconscious. If the target dies because of the damage from the triggering damage, this spell has no effect and its casting is wasted.
