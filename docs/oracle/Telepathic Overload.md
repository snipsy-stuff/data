### 📜 Description
You surround yourself with a sphere of bizarre telepathic images and thoughts of a totally random nature. Within a radius of 5 feet per caster level, this sphere negates all forms of telepathy and telepathic links. Additionally, anyone attempting to read a creature's thoughts (with the third round of detect thoughts, a helm of telepathy, etc.) must make a Will save or take 1d10 points of damage and be stunned for 1 round.
