### 📜 Description
This spell allows you to bend space around yourself to divert an attack. If the attack affects an area, you suffer only half damage. If it is targeted at you, it has a 50% miss chance (or a 50% chance to simply fail, if it does not require an attack roll), and you gain a +2 deflection bonus to your AC against it; this bonus increases by +1 for every 5 levels after 5th.

You may instead choose to bend yourself around space. Until the end of your turn, your reach is increased by 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet per 5 levels after 5th.

With either use of the spell, you must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to enable your body to readjust to normal space; if failed, you take 2 points of Strength damage.
