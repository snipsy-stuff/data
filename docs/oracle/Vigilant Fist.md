### 📜 Description
You create an invisible, immobile, warded area. If anything moving intrudes into this area, the vigilant fist activates. The area can include existing elements that move, such as hanging curtains or lamps, and their movements won't trigger the magic, but if anything new enters the area, the spell awakens.

The air of the warded area solidifies into an invisible fist that strikes the intruder with a single blow. It receives a +9 bonus to hit (spell resistance reduces this to no attack bonus), and it deals bludgeoning damage of 4d4+1 hp per level. At the same time, the air gives you a solid but harmless rap on the knuckles or shoulder to awaken or alert you to the intrusion. If there are multiple intruders, the foremost will be attacked; if multiple intruders attack in a line and none is foremost, the largest is struck (if they are the same size, a random intruder will be struck).

A vigilant fist is usually cast in an entrance, across a passage, behind the caster, or to guard a back way while the caster personally guards the front. The caster of vigilant fist can't be taken unawares when sleeping.
