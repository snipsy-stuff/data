### 📜 Description
You amplify the animating force of a construct to more closely resemble a true soul, granting the construct humanlike sentience. To do so, you must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the construct’s current Hit Dice). If the construct’s master (if any) is present, this is an opposed Spellcraft check. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken—it is a free-willed creature. Golems previously under another creature’s control, either as shield guardians or a golem crafter’s creations, break all connections with that creature.

Roll 3d6 to determine the Intelligence score of the awakened construct, and increase its Charisma score by 2d6. It gains feats and skill points according to its new Intelligence score, and the skill points are assigned appropriately for its function, as determined by the GM.

An awakened construct speaks one language that its creator spoke, plus one additional language that its creator knew per point of the construct’s Intelligence bonus (if any). Its alignment is determined by the GM, but is usually within one step of its creator’s alignment. This spell doesn’t function on a construct with an Intelligence score.
