### üìú Description
A wall of shimmering blocks and intangible, moving gears springs into existence. Non-magical ranged attacks that cross the wall vanish into time. The wall offers total concealment (50% miss chance) against magical ranged attacks and spells that pass through the wall. A creature that passes through the wall is slowed, per the spell slow, for the duration of this spell.

This wall is considered a force effect.
