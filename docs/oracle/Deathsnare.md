### 📜 Description
You draw forth the life force of helpless creatures in the area, using it to empower yourself. Non-helpless creatures are unaffected, but should any creature gain the helpless condition while in the area, or should the area move into a region where creatures are helpless, they die. You gain 1d8 temporary hit points and regain one 4th-level or lower spell slot (if you prepare spells you can prepare that slot with a spell you that you currently have prepared) each time a creature dies as the result of this spell, even if you have cast that spell to your normal daily limit already. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells. This effect happens only once. These effects last for the spell's duration.
