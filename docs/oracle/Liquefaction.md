### 📜 Description
You cause the ground to tremble violently, and water erupts from newly formed cracks in the earth. Any creature standing in the area must make a Reflex save at the beginning of its turn each round or fall prone. Creatures in the area that move faster than half its speed fall prone. Prone creatures in the area must succeed on a Reflex save to stand up. Spellcasters in the area must succeed on a concentration check (DC 15 + the spell's level) to successfully cast a spell; failing this check causes the spell to be lost. Attacks rolls from creatures in the area take a -2 penalty and both running and charging are not possible.
