### 📜 Description
The body of the target creature twists and distorts, reshaping into a grotesque figure. Because of the disfigurement, the creature takes a –4 penalty to Constitution and Charisma. The creature also receives one of the following deformities (your choice) from the list in the mutant acquired template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5 180): blind, deaf, fragile, fractured mind, lame, poor ability (applied to your choice of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom), spasms, and useless arm. The deformity is subject to all limitations described in the mutant template (for example, this spell cannot impose the lame deformity on a creature with a base speed slower than 20 feet).
