### 📜 Description
The spellcaster is able to remove all the features from the target creature's face as if they had never been: eyes, ears, nose and mouth. A target must make a save for each facial feature; failure removes one set of features. Note that permanently removing the victim's features causes various adverse effects:

• Removing the eyes inflicts the blindness condition.

• Removing the ears inflicts the deafness condition.

• Removing the victim's nose means he can no longer smell and loses the scent ability.

• Removing the victim's mouth means he can no longer eat, speak (no vocal component spells), and may eventually starve.

• Removing both the victim's nose and mouth means he can no longer breathe, and he becomes immediately subject to the drowning rules. The victim or someone else may cut a new breathing hole with a successful Heal check (DC 11 + your caster level) suffering 1d4 points of damage per attempt.

Remove curse does not remove blank face. Greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.
