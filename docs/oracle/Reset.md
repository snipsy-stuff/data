### 📜 Description
Temporal energies burst from your form to cover the battlefield. At the beginning of the following round, all creatures in the spell's radius at the time of casting reroll their initiative. Allies receive a +4 bonus to this roll. Enemies who fail their Will saves receive a -4 penalty to this roll. Creatures involved in the combat who were not in the spell's range keep their current initiative. The new combat initiative begins with the subsequent round; no creature should receive an extra action due to the effects of this spell.
