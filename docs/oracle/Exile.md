### üìú Description
This spell allows the cleric to cast someone off his home soil. If the target fails his save, he is marked as an exile within the boundaries of the caster's tribe or kingdom and may not be given shelter or assistance by anyone in that tribe or kingdom. Any community member who makes a Perception check (DC 15) recognizes his exile status. Anyone who provides aid to exiles with that tribe or kingdom suffer a bestow curse. 

An exile has two days to begin to leave the tribal land or kingdom; thereafter, he takes 1d8 damage at dawn on any day he isn't closer to the border of the designated land than the morning before. He cannot heal naturally or gain the benefits of a conjuration (healing) spell within the designated land. The level of the caster determines the area from which he is alienated. An 11th-level cleric can exile a person from a 50 square mile area, and that area doubles every level after that: 100 square miles at 12th level, 200 at 13th, 400 at 14th, 800 at 15th, and so on. An 11th-level cleric could exile someone from the area of a small town and its surrounding farmland. A 13th-level cleric could exile someone from a city-state and its surrounding farmland. A 15th-level cleric could exile someone from a whole province. A 19th-level cleric could exile someone from an entire nation. A 20thlevel cleric could exile someone from a continent. The spell can only be countered by a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle or wish spell cast by a member of the same religion as the priest who exiled him.
