### 📜 Description
You crown yourself with a shining aura of light. The crown of empyreal glory sheds light equal to sunlight in a 30-ft. radius, bright light in the next 60 ft., and dim light for another 90 ft. Creatures that are damaged, weakened, or destroyed by light (i.e. vampire weaknesses) are subject to such effects if they are within 30 ft. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the first 90 ft. of the crown's light.

If you channel positive energy while crown of empyreal glory is in effect, you add 2d6 to any rolls for healing or damage. You also increase the save DC by 2 for any effects using positive energy channels, including feats such as Channel Smite or Turn Undead.

The light this spell produces counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal level or lower.
