### 📜 Description
You reveal how the norns have entwined the fates of nearby allies and enemies. For every ally targeted by this spell, you must also target an enemy within range. If you do not do this, the spell fails.

For the duration of the spell, every target gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls made against opponents also affected by the spell. In addition, all critical hits are automatically confirmed against such opponents and all targets can identify fellow subjects of this spell by sight, as a free action.

If a subject of the spell makes any of the above checks against a target other than those also subject to this spell, the subject suffers a -2 penalty.
