### 📜 Description
Meteorite evokes a piece of celestial matter and rains it down upon a foe. When you cast it, the meteorite appears as high above the target as the immediate environment allows (raining down from the sky if no ceiling). The mundane meteorite streaks down with an orange glow, leaving a visible tail and audible thunder in its wake. Make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteorite. Any creature struck by the meteorite receives no saving throw and takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6); one half of this is bludgeoning damage and the other half is fire damage. If a targeted meteorite misses its target, it simply explodes at that point. Once a meteorite strikes, it explodes in a 20-foot radius spread (similar to a fireball's) that deals 1d6 points of fire damage/2 caster levels (maximum 12d6) to each other creature in the area (Reflex save for half damage).
