### 📜 Description
You imbue a shield with battleward properties. It glows with a shimmering blue radiance, and it reflects non-area-of-effect spells contacting it or its bearer entirely unless the attacking caster makes a touch attack against the shield's bearer. Any reflected spells drain away without further effect.

At any time after its first round of existence, the caster of a battleward can, as a swift action, transform the reflected spell into a fly magic, enabling the shield and its bearer to fly. The magic carries shield, bearer, and any armor and other items worn, strapped, or attached to him or her (up to the bearer's encumbrance limit), plus anything else held by the bearer that is the shield's weight or less. Once this change is made, the spell reflection property cannot be regained.
