### 📜 Description
Each minute that your target performs a specific action you tell it to discontinue or refrain from (specified when this spell is cast), it suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to all rolls and increasingly frequent visions of the moments leading up to its death. The spell is so disturbing that the target takes a cumulative -1 penalty/minute to all rolls if it performs the forbidden action.  If the spell expires before the target starts or discontinues the action, the target envisions its death and must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 2d6 hp damage. The stated action cannot be one that would result in certain death if discontinued. You define the exact visions the target sees.
