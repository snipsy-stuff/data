### 📜 Description
In order to prepare this spell, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

This spell enhances the target’s dwarven or dwarf-like qualities, making it appear more attractive, personable, and worthy of respect and admiration by dwarves. The target is still recognizable as itself. The target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to influence dwarves (such as Diplomacy, Intimidate, and so on).
