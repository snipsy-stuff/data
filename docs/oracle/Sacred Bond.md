### 📜 Description
To use this spell, you first touch the intended recipient, creating a sympathetic field of healing energies between you. Once the spell has been cast, you and the target may cast conjuration (healing) spells with a range of touch upon each other so long as you are within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Should either you or the target remove your bracelet, the spell immediately ends.
