### 📜 Description
The energies of this spell are directed at clouds overhead, which take on the form of an adult gold or silver dragon under your control. This dragon has partial substance and is capable of transporting up to six Medium (or smaller) creatures on its back, just as a regular dragon can; however, it cannot make attacks and doesn't possess a breath weapon. Whenever you are unable to concentrate on controlling the actions of the cloud dragon, it simply stops, hanging motionless despite winds or gravity, until you resume control or the spell expires (whereupon the dragon vanishes). The cloud dragon flies with the speed and maneuverability of an adult gold or silver dragon. To cast this spell, you must have seen a real gold or silver dragon and be outdoors, able to see clouds in the sky.
