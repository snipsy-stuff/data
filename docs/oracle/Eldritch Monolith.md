### 📜 Description
This spell is identical to eldritch monolith, but any creature touching or adjacent to the illusory structure is affected as bestow curse, even if it disbelieves. Spell resistance applies against this effect and a Will save negates it.

If learned and cast as a mythos spell, you may choose to inflict a spellblight, a form of insanity, or a variant curse effect such as curse of the ages or unluck rather than the usual effects of bestow curse.
