### 📜 Description
This spell causes a section of floor to sprout a field of gnashing maws that constantly snap and gibber. The mouths bite any creature within the area.

Make separate melee touch attacks against every creature within the area each round at the start of your turn, including the round the spell is cast. Creatures entering the area are also automatically attacked. The teeth do not make attacks of opportunity. The teeth use your base attack bonus with a +4 Dexterity bonus and a +1 size bonus when making attacks.

On a hit, the teeth deal 3d8+4 hp piercing and bludgeoning damage and 3 bleed damage. Bitten creatures must also make a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or become entangled for 1 round.

The teeth created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is difficult terrain for as long as the teeth last.
