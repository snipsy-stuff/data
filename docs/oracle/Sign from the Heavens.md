### 📜 Description
This spell duplicates the effects of a miracle in all respects including any required gp costs, provided that you succeed at a caster level check (DC = your caster level + d20). You cannot influence the outcome of your caster level check by using an effect that generates automatic success, changes the results of a die roll or allows you to roll again. No matter the outcome of the spell, the 5,000 gp is consumed in the casting.
