### 📜 Description
The subject contracts a severe case of scurvy, becoming both fatigued and sickened. If the target is already fatigued or exhausted, the additional fatigue has no effect. If the target has not eaten fresh food within 24 hours, it suffers a −2 penalty to its saving throw against this spell. An affected target that eats a citrus fruit (normally a full-round action, assuming one is at hand) recovers at the start of its next turn.

Non-mammalian creatures of the animal type are immune to this spell.
