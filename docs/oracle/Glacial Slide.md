### üìú Description
You create an artificial glacier that slowly moves in any direction that you choose at the time of casting; however, once set in motion, the glacier continues moving in the designated direction until the spell's duration expires or an intervening barrier prevents it from moving any further. The ice moves at a rate of 5 ft. per round, and slowly crushes any immobile creatures, objects and structures in its path. When the glacier comes into contact with any immobile object or structure, the glacier deals 25d6 points of damage. If the object or structure withstands the damage, the glacier's progress is halted in that particular location. Creatures unable to escape its path also take 25d6 points of cold and crushing damage (50% each) and are entitled to a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half. They are subsequently buried within the glacier and take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from the glacier's weight and 1d6 points of cold damage per minute within the ice. Targets rendered unconscious must make a Constitution check (DC 15 + 1 per previous check) each minute or suffer 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. In addition to the aforementioned physical damage, a buried creature also lacks breathable air and immediately starts suffocating. Small objects are simply swept away and entombed inside of the glacier. 

Each 10-foot square of glacier has 90 hp. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall reduced to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature (including a buried creature) tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the glacier) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save). Fire can melt a glacial slide, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a glacial slide creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
