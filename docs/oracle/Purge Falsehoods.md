### üìú Description
You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that removes polymorph and glamer effects from creatures in the area, returning them to their true forms, even against their will. Against creatures affected by polymorph or glamer spell effects (such as baleful polymorph or invisibility), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +20) against a DC of 11 + caster level of each effect. Success means that the polymorph or glamer effect immediately ends. 

A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) or become glamered must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form or become visible. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, this casting of the spell no longer affects the creature and the creature is capable of changing shape or becoming glamered once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form or visible for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph or glamer effects from changing its shape or altering its appearance. 

Each creature in the sphere of purge falsehoods is subject to having all glamers and all polymorph effects on it affected. Caster level checks must be made against each effect for each target, and any successful checks are then met with saving throws. So it's possible, for instance, for an invisible werewolf in the area of effect to end up being a visible werewolf, an invisible man, a visible man, or, in the case of two failed caster level checks, to remain an invisible werewolf.
