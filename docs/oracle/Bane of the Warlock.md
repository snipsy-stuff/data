### 📜 Description
This spell creates a blast of divine energy that causes anyone who can cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability to take 1d6 divine damage per 2 levels (maximum 10d6 damage) and be stunned for one round. A successful saving throw results in half damage and reduces the stunned condition to the staggered condition for one round. After a target has its first successful saving throw against this spell, further castings against that target cannot inflict the staggered condition for 24 hours.
