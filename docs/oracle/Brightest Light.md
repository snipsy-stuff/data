### 📜 Description
This trademark spell of the Lantern Bearers, a secret elven organization, functions as daylight, except it lasts longer and automatically dispels lower-level darkness spells when their points of origin enter its illumination.

In addition, as a standard action once during the spell’s duration, you can will the light to try to snuff out a magical darkness effect that is of an equal or higher spell level and located within 60 feet of the light this spell emits. Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level), with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the darkness effect. If you succeed, the darkness effect ends. Regardless of whether you are successful, the brightest light dims to the brightness of a torch for the spell’s remaining duration.
