### 📜 Description
All living creatures within the area of effect, including yourself, must immediately attempt a saving throw with a -2 penalty against any and all diseases they have contracted, even if the onset time has not yet elapsed. On a failed saving throw, the affliction has its usual effect. A successful save does not count toward curing the affliction.
