### üìú Description
A scourge is an extremely powerful curse. It can be cast over a vast distance; as a result, it is often used to punish heretics and criminals who cannot be brought to face justice. When you cast scourge you can choose to duplicate any of the effects of a curse of lower level (curse spells are those that cannot be dispelled but can only be affected by break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, and/or wish) or you can select one of the following effects:

‚Ä¢ Acrimony - People can't explain why they don't like the victim; he just seems suspicious and hateful. NPC allies and friends can resist this somewhat, but will still find the character strangely repellent; they may suspect that he has been replaced by a doppelganger. In addition, any sort of spell used to detect alignment will always respond with the alignment most hostile to the caster, and discern lies will always show the victim as lying.

‚Ä¢ Aging - The victim ages one age category at the start of each day.

‚Ä¢ Barren Touch - Any food or drink touched by the victim spoils. Any plants he tills die. Any Heal checks he makes automatically fail, and any cure spells he casts have a 50% chance of becoming inflict spells of the same level.

‚Ä¢ Ignominy - Anyone who comes into contact with the victim will forget any noble or valorous deeds she has done, while clearly remembering any crimes she has committed or mistakes she has made. People will attribute the character's greatest achievements to other people (other party members, for example, or legendary heroes). If the curse is lifted, these memories will return.

‚Ä¢ Ostracism - The victim is surrounded by an aura that causes all NPCs to have a hostile attitude toward him. This also results in a permanent -6 penalty to the victim's Charisma score, to a minimum score of 1.

‚Ä¢ Poverty - Any precious metal that the victim touches turns to lead. 

‚Ä¢ Prohibition - You specify a specific action that the victim cannot take. "Do not lie" or "Do not physically hurt humans" will work; impossible or broad requests like "Do not breathe" or "Never hurt anyone in any way" will not. Any time that the victim attempts the prohibited action, she must make a Will save (using the DC of the scourge). If she succeeds, she can perform the action unhindered; otherwise she is wracked with extreme pain suffering a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks (these penalties last for 1 hour); in addition she suffers from the Stunned condition for 1d4+1 rounds.

You can come up with similar effects with your GM's permission. 

When you cast the spell you must declare a set of circumstances that will cause the curse to be broken. Depending on the reasons for inflicting the scourge, this could range from "save an innocent man from death" or "submit to Kheshite justice," to "Defeat the demon lord Xarglbarg" or even "Find true love." The subject is automatically made aware of this escape clause and the clause is subject to GM approval. 

This curse cannot be dispelled, and it can only be removed with a remove curse (which only grants a second saving throw, but if unsuccessful it has no additional effect), break enchantment (as remove curse), limited wish, miracle, or wish spell.
