### 📜 Description
In order to prepare this spell, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

You can attempt to influence unfriendly or hostile creatures, altering their attitudes toward you. After casting, make a Diplomacy check against the creatures as a free action; you gain a +2 sacred bonus on this check against creatures that failed their saves against the spell. Even if you favorably manipulate the attitude of the affected targets, they quickly revert to their previous attitude if threatened or treated poorly.
