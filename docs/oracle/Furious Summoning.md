### 📜 Description
While affected by this spell, you cast summon monster spells that summon chaotic or evil creatures at one level higher than your own. The alignment effects stack, so if you summon chaotic evil creatures, you summon them as two levels higher.

Furthermore, when you summon a creature with the demon subtype, you can choose to have it affected as if you had cast the rage spell on it, even if that spell is not a known spell to you or on your class spell list. Lastly, when casting summon monster you can choose to dismiss this spell as a free action to have the casting time of the summoning spell reduced to 1 standard action.
