### üìú Description
You animate corpses, forming them into a wall of joined flesh and limbs. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall can‚Äôt be created so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must be vertical, but can be shaped as you see fit.

The wall is considered to be undead. It uses your Will saving throw to resist channel energy.

A flesh wall is 2 feet thick. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. As a move action, you can cause the fleshwall to constrict, shrinking it by a 5-foot square to fill the hole. Additionally, as a standard action, you can cause a 5-foot square of the wall to permanently detach, forming a human zombie (Bestiary 288) under your verbal control (this zombie doesn‚Äôt count against your normal limit of commanded undead). The zombie reverts back into a normal corpse when the spell‚Äôs effect ends. Each 5-foot square of the wall makes a single slam attack against an adjacent enemy on your turn, as a human zombie. The squares of the wall threaten their adjacent squares and can even provide flanking.

Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. The DC to move through the wall is equal to 15 + your caster level. A creature that fails the check is trapped in the wall, takes 3d6 points of crushing damage, and is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the wall‚Äôs slam attack. The creature can make an attempt to escape the wall on its next turn.

You can use zombies already under your control as the material components for a flesh wall. However, they and any other corpses in the wall revert back to inanimate corpses when the spell ends.
