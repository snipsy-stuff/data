### 📜 Description
You summon a small sphere of energy to breach doors, walls, objects, or to attack creatures. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit a target. The sphere deals 2d6 hp acid damage + 1d6 every two levels beyond 4th. Living creatures may make a Fortitude save to halve the damage.

A breaching sphere can reduce the hardness of objects it touches. For casters up to 9th level, it negates 5 hardness; for casters 10th to 14th level it negates 10 hardness; and for casters 15th level or higher it negates 15 hardness.
