### 📜 Description
The recipient of this spell becomes completely lost and cannot find its way. Unless led (by another creature or a map, for example), the creature wanders aimlessly about seeking its destination (which it remembers; it just can't remember how to get there) for the duration of the spell. Any destination an affected creature seeks is lost to it for the duration, not just one it may have had in mind when this spell took effect. This spell is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians). Lost wanderer counters and dispels find the path. Likewise, find the path counters and dispels lost wanderer.
