### 📜 Description
Siphon life deals 10 points of damage per caster level and heals you for an amount equal to the damage dealt. If this healing would exceed your normal hit point total you gain temporary hit points equal to the remaining damage you deal. You can't heal or gain more temporary hit points than the sum of the subject's current hit points and the subject's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points disappear one hour later. If the creature successfully saves, siphon life deals half this amount.
