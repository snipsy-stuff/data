### üìú Description
Over the course of the one-hour casting time, the subject is indoctrinated in the beliefs of your deity and/or ethos. Forbidden conversion can achieve two different objectives, or both of them. When both are attempted, the subject makes two saving throws, one for each effect. This spell does not force the subject to listen. The caster must arrange that with a successful Bluff, Diplomacy or Intimidate check against the subject's Sense Motive check or he may employ force by incapacitating the subject in some manner that leaves the subject conscious: tying him up, paralyzing him, etc. The two different objectives of forbidden conversion are explained below.

‚Ä¢ Alignment Shift: Cast in this way, on a failed saving throw, the subject's alignment shifts one degree toward that of your deity's alignment. The subject's alignment will shift the farthest alignment component first. A cleric of a chaotic neutral deity casting this spell on a lawful good subject would cause his alignment to shift to neutral good. When both alignment axes are equally different, the cleric can choose which axis to affect. A cleric of a chaotic evil deity casting this spell on a neutral subject chooses whether the subject becomes neutral evil or chaotic neutral if the subject fails the saving throw.

‚Ä¢ Conversion: Cast in this way, the subject is forcibly converted to the worship of the caster's deity. Devout followers of another deity (clerics, paladins, etc.) get a +4 bonus to their saving throw against this version of the spell. If the subject's alignment is not compatible with the beliefs of the deity, this conversion will eventually fade over time.

Nothing short of a limited wish, miracle, wish or another casting of forbidden conversion can reverse the effects of this spell.

Note: Many deities will refuse to grant their clerics access to this spell or to one of the versions of the spell. The use of limited wish, miracle, wish or this spell to reverse a prior casting of this spell may not require the XP cost if the deity granting the spell would normally not allow that form of this spell to be cast.
