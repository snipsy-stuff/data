### 📜 Description
The target's bones take on a life of their own and move within the target's flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save each round this spell is in effect as the target's skeleton animates from within. Each failure means the target takes 1d6 hp of negative energy damage and 1 point of Constitution damage, and it becomes staggered and sickened for 1 round. If the target makes its save, it takes no hp or Constitution damage but is still sickened for 1 round.

If the target creature dies during the duration of this spell, its remaining flesh immediately falls away and its type changes to undead as it becomes an animated skeleton (wearing and wielding all of the target's equipment). Starting on your next turn and lasting until the spell ends, the skeleton is under your direct control. When the spell duration expires, the controlled skeleton collapses into a heap of bones.

Protection from evil negates this spell's effects for as long as the two durations overlap. Dispel evil automatically ends the spell. This spell has no effect on creatures without internal skeletons.
