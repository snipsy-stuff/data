### 📜 Description
This spell releases a burst of foul, life-destroying energy from the negative energy plane. All land in the area of effect blackens and is forever ruined.

The spell reduces all plants to cinders.

Against plant creatures, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum of 20d6). Defile is equally effective against other opponents. Against living creatures (except vermin, which are immune), the spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum of 10d8). Those killed by this blast rise up uncontrolled with the corporeal undead creature template 1d4 rounds later.

All water on the despoiled land turns poisonous as if tainted with lich dust (See Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). Finally, necromancy spells cast in the area affected by defile are cast at +1 caster level and the DCs to save against their effects are increased by 1.

A wish or miracle spell is needed to repair land ruined by this spell.

Undead caught in the defile spell's burst heal all damage and gain maximum hit points based on their Hit Dice. For example, a Medium zombie who has 2d12+3 Hit Dice and 16 hp increases its hit point total to 27 because of this spell.
