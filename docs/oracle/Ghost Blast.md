### 📜 Description
Ghost blast sets off an explosion on the Ethereal Plane at any location you choose within range. This explosion deals 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) to any creatures on the Ethereal Plane or incorporeal creatures within the area. This blast does not affect most creatures dwelling on the Material Plane, but, unlike most spells, it does deal damage to incorporeal creatures on the Material Plane and because it is a force effect, it does not suffer a miss chance. If a creature is both Ethereal and incorporeal, such as a ghost, it does not take damage twice. Ghost blast can be cast on the Ethereal Plane, but it does not work in reverse, meaning that if cast on the Ethereal Plane, it still affects the Ethereal Plane.
