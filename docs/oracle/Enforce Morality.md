### üìú Description
You fill the target with your morality and ideology - the creature gains your alignment and outlook. This feeling extends down to the core of the target's being, making him or her a true convert and your friend as if affected by charm monster, as well as stripping away his or her own personality (though not his or her memories). Those affected often show extreme mood swings, episodes of maniacal laughter and a very strong feeling of contempt for your enemies. 

Often, this spell's effects will be manifested when normal deeds become twisted perversions of the original intent. For example, a noble knight afflicted by this spell by a chaotic evil cleric may deem it just not only to eliminate his opponent on the honorable field of battle, but also to purify him through pain and so torture him to death. This spell might also manifest its effects in other ways, such as subtle smirks in response to grisly things. 

Those who know the target well can make a Sense Motive check (DC 40) to determine that the target is under the effect of a spell. Characters or creatures that already share your alignment are unaffected by this spell.

This spell is most often used by evil clerics to cause paladins and good clerics to fall from grace, at least during the duration of the spell, if not longer. When the spell expires, the target retains all of the feelings and actions while under the influence of the spell.
