### 📜 Description
With a twisting gesture, you create a path to freedom that possibly cuts off any damages pursuers. This spell opens a tunnel through any barrier (such as walls or solid rock). This tunnel is sized for the caster, and is 400 ft. + 40 ft./level long; if the total distance permits, the caster can have the tunnel fork, branch and dead end. The caster always knows the proper route through the passage. In addition, the caster, along with those who enter on his initiative, are cloaked in a nondetection effect for the duration of the spell. This entrance closes one round after the caster enters the tunnel but those who don't enter on the same initiative as the caster must make a successful Reflex save or be shunted back out of the rock to the beginning of the entrance, suffering 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6). Those killed by this damage are sealed within the barrier. This space remains until the occupant dies or leaves the area of effect. The spell can require a second save of those within the tunnel if the spell's duration ends, the caster dies, or the caster dismisses the spell; a successful save results in those inside arriving at the closest entrance or exit (the caster's body remains trapped unless attended by another living creature).
