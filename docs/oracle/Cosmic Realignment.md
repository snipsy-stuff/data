### 📜 Description
The target of this spell is temporarily disconnected from its cosmic fate, and it takes on yours for a short time. You and the target creature swap your alignments for a short time, each taking on the other's fate and cosmic trajectory.

If the target already shares your alignment or is one step away, this spell grants it a +2 moral bonus on all attack rolls and saving throws. If the target is of any other alignment, it instead bestows a -2 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws. Furthermore, if the target is two or more alignment steps removed from yours, it must succeed on a Will save each round at the beginning of its turn or become confused for the spell's duration.

Lastly, if the target has one or more alignment subtypes that is different than your alignment (for example, if you are lawful good, this affects creatures with the chaotic and/or evil subtype), they are automatically confused each round.
