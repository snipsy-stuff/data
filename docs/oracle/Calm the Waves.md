### 📜 Description
This spell reduces the size and strength of waves in a body of water, making it easier to swim or sail through the affected area. Stormy or rough water conditions, including tides and undertows, whether above the surface or below, immediately become calm for the duration of the spell, requiring DC 10 Swim checks to move through and adding 1 mph to the speed of sailing ships.
