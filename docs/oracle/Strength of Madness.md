### 📜 Description
You transfer the maddening power of the Dark Tapestry into a target with your touch. To cast this spell on an unwilling target, you must make a touch attack; casting this spell on a willing creature does not require an attack roll

The target receives a -2 penalty to Will saves and gains a +1 profane bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. At 8th level, and every three levels thereafter, the profane bonus increases to +2 and the penalty to Will saves increases by -2, and the spell also encompasses Reflex saves. At 14th level, Fortitude saves also take the penalty. The bonus to attack and damage increases by +2, to a maximum of -10 to all saves and +6 to attack and damage rolls at 20th level.

At any level while this spell is in effect, when rolling a natural 1 on a Will save the target experiences confusion, as the spell, for 1d4 rounds.
