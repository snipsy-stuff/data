### 📜 Description
You place a potent curse on the creature touched, choosing one of the following effects:

• A -10 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1) • A -8 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks • Each turn, the target has a 25% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action

You may also invent your own greater curse, but it should be no more powerful than those listed above. The GM has final say on the curse's effect. This curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse (which grants a second saving throw, but if successful it has no additional effect), break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell.
