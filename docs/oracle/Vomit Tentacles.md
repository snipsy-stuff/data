### üìú Description
Upon casting this spell, your jaws distend and you spew myriad thin, slimy tentacles from your mouth, which grasp and bind your opponents. While the spell is in effect, you are incapable of speech and cannot cast spells with verbal components.

The tentacles have a 15-ft. reach and can initiate a grapple on any one foe within range. The tentacles' CMB uses your character level as its base attack bonus with a +4 Strength bonus (or your own bonus, whichever is higher) and a +1 size bonus. If the grapple is successful, the tentacles inflict 1d6 hp+4 (or your Str bonus, if it's higher) damage and the target gains the grappled condition.

Each round the grapple is maintained, the tentacles inflict another 1d6+4 (or your Str bonus, if it's higher), and they can perform other grapple maneuvers. The CMD for escaping the tentacles is equal to 10 + their CMB + your Dex modifier. The tentacles can grapple more than one opponent at a time, but they may only grapple one opponent per round, and they may only grapple foes adjacent to you

The tentacles provide a +4 racial bonus to drag and reposition maneuvers against targets grappled by the tentacles, and you provoke no attacks of opportunity for performing these maneuvers. You also gain a +4 competence bonus to your CMD against such maneuvers if they are attempted by your grappled foe. The tentacles can be attacked to free the grappled opponents. Inflicting 5 hp slashing damage per your level severs enough tentacles to free all grappled opponents. Any severed tentacles regrow so long as the spell persists, and they are usable again on your next action.
