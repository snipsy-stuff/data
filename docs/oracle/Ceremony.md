### üìú Description
You harness divine power to create one of four different ceremonies‚Äîa funeral, holiday fete, marriage, or naming‚Äîand can also create two domain-based ceremonies. Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell.

If you are using the downtime system from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.

Unless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature‚Äôs highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so.

Funeral: A funeral service must involve a corpse and at least one willing companion or next of kin. The subject gains a +2 sacred bonus against death effects.
Holiday Fete: A holiday fete may involve up to two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves.
Marriage: A marriage must involve two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on saves against fear and emotion effects.
Naming: A naming must involve a willing parent or parents and a newborn (who is touched but unaffected). The subject can use sanctuary once.

The augmented versions of these four ceremonies are identical, granting the subject a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws.

In addition to these four ceremonies, each cleric gains two more ceremonies according to her domain. For information on domain ceremonies and their relevant boons, see Quests and Campaigns pg 24-25.
