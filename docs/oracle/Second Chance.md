### 📜 Description
The subject can attempt a new saving throw to shrug off one unwanted ongoing condition or effect. Second chance does not heal damage already suffered from an effect or condition. If an effect doesn't allow a save, or if it has a duration of Instantaneous, then second chance has no effect. The save DC is the same as for the first saving throw. Effects with a Permanent duration add +2 to the DC of the second save. This spell can be cast only once per unwanted condition - if the second save fails, this spell cannot help.
