### 📜 Description
This spell requires two people, one designated as a provider and one as a recipient. The provider is used as a mask for the recipient, who is polymorphed into the provider's form as if by the polymorph spell. The recipient gains the provider's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores, and all the provider's extraordinary special attacks. In addition, a portion of the provider's personality is imbued in the recipient. The recipient gains a +1 competence bonus to all skill checks for skills that the provider also has ranks in. The recipient also gains a +5 bonus to all Bluff checks and a +15 bonus to all Disguise checks made to convince others that he is in fact the provider. 

The provider suffers a -2 penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks.
