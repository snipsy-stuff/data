### 📜 Description
You send forth a burst of entropy, guiding the random changes toward a negative result, causing matter to decay as though it were aging quickly. The wave of entropic energy deals 1d8 points of damage per level (maximum 20d8) to creatures, and 1 point of damage per level (maximum 25) to objects (subtract hardness). Since the torrent passes through barriers, it can weaken entire areas, not just the surface of objects. This has the general effect of weakening metal enough that it can be broken like sturdy wood, weakening stone or crystal enough that it can be dug through like dirt, or completely reducing weaker structures to dust. Objects weakened in this way do not change in composition, only sturdiness. Decayed gold becomes gold dust, and ice merely turns to snow. A successful save results in half damage. Attended objects are unaffected if their bearer succeeds on his save, but are weakened as normal if the bearer fails his save. Entropic torrent can easily cripple a living creature and leave him naked and defenseless.
