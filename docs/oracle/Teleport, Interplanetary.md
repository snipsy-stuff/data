### 📜 Description
This spell functions as teleport, save that there is truly no range limit and you do not need to have seen your destination, though you must have a solid grasp of which world you wish to travel to ("Verces" is an acceptable destination, but "a habitable world near that bright star" is not). If you have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without a chance of failure, otherwise you arrive at a location that would not immediately be life-threatening. If no such safe landing zone exists on the world, such as someone attempting to travel into the sun without the proper precautions in place, the spell simply fails.
