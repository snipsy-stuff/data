### 📜 Description
This spell halts the normal processes of degradation in a non-magical clockwork device, rendering normal maintenance unnecessary and slowing fuel consumption to 1/10th normal. For magical devices and constructs, the spell greatly slows wear.

The affected magical device does not suffer any penalties for long-term wear, nor does it need fuel, grease, or winding nearly as often. A magical clockwork device, machine, or creature that normally requires daily maintenance instead needs care only once per year. One that requires only monthly maintenance can go a decade between checks.
