### 📜 Description
You or a creature you touch take on all the characteristics of a face of a Medium humanoid you've seen, including a younger version of yourself. This magic affects only the appearance of the head, neck, shoulders, collarbone, and upper chest (front and back). The spell can transform your appearance into another race or gender, but only in the ways described.

The effectiveness of the disguise depends upon the clarity of the memory used to shape it. Consequently, many habitual users of this spell carry detailed miniature paintings (e.g. in lockets) to refer to, or they look at bystanders and copy their features.

Face of deception is often used to pass checkpoints, blend in with guards or officers, and to temporarily disguise identity. If used as part of a disguise, this spell grants a +10 to Disguise checks. Anyone who interacts with a creature disguised this way immediately receives a Will save to recognize the disguised creature (or to simply recognize that the creature is under the effects of this spell).
