### 📜 Description
This spell momentarily unravels the fibers of reality, creating a tensed rift that then snaps back into congruence with the world around it, catapulting you to a new location. A reality riptide acts as a dimension door, but your arrival creates a shockwave in a 20-foot burst centered upon you that acts as simultaneous bull rush and trip maneuvers with a CMB equal to your caster level plus your Wisdom modifier. The shockwave affects creatures accompanying you and creatures in the area when you arrive but does not affect you. At the point of your departure, the implosive unraveling creates a 5-foot radius spread of black tentacles centered on your former position, as well as a drag maneuver towards it using the same CMB noted above.

Any creature traveling with this spell must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or have their tissues and equipment partially unraveled into ropy strands, causing 2 points of Dexterity damage.
