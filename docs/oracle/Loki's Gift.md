### 📜 Description
Loki's gift makes even the most bare-faced lie seem strangely plausible. After casting this spell, you gain a +5 profane bonus to Bluff for the lie you are telling, which is the verbal component of the spell.

For the next 24 hours, you also may coax a single target whose reaction toward you is friendly or better to reveal one potentially embarrassing secret about him or herself or someone else. The secret may involve personal wrongdoing (adultery, cheating at gambling, a secret fear, etc.) but not something life-threatening or dishonorable enough to put the creature in mortal danger. A successful Will save negates this effect and immediately turns the target's reaction hostile.
