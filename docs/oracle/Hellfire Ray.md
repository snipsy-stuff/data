### 📜 Description
A blast of hellfire blazes from your hands. You can fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every 4 caster levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of three rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from unholy power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by fire resistance. The rays can be fired at the same target or at different targets, but all rays must be fired simultaneously and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other.

Any creature killed by this spell must make a Will saving throw; failure means the creature's soul is damned to Hell as a burst of brimstone appears around its corpse. A non-evil spellcaster attempting to bring the character back from the dead must make a caster level check (DC equal to 10 plus the slain creature's level) to succeed; failure means the spellcaster cannot try again for 1 day. Evil spellcasters can raise the slain character normally, without a check. A raised character’s soul is no longer automatically consigned to Hell.
