### 📜 Description
This ancient and powerful rite causes disastrous luck to befall a creature. The creature can never again safely travel over land, nor can he be a part of any crew on a vessel. The target of this curse has the material component hung around his neck, marking him as cursed. Placing the component around the neck requires an attack roll on the part of the caster. Success means that the component has been placed around the neck; even if removed immediately, the curse takes effect. From this point on, the target can never travel again. The effects of the curse can be many-fold; a colossal monster more than seven CR higher than the highest level character on the vessel may come to attack the conveyance, terrible weather or a disaster (see Advanced Players Guide) plagues the subject and the vessel he travels on. The GM is encouraged to make up any circumstance that will stop or slow the creature's progress to a crawl. In all cases, the curse at the very least destroys the vessel or conveyance that the subject uses.

This spell cannot be dispelled but can be removed with a miracle or wish spell.
