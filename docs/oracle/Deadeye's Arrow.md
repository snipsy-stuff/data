### 📜 Description
You create an arrow made of crackling electricity, which you may use for one of two effects.

Attack: You may throw the arrow up to Medium range or fire it from a bow up to the bow's maximum range. Either use is a ranged touch attack. The arrow deals electricity damage equal to 1d6 +1 point per level (maximum +5).

Beacon: You throw or fire the arrow straight up. When it reaches maximum range or a solid surface (such as the roof of a cave) it explodes in a peal of thunder and a forked bolt of electricity resembling Erastil's holy symbol, which lingers for 1 round. The thunder and lightning are as loud and bright as natural thunder and lightning, but do not harm nearby creatures.
