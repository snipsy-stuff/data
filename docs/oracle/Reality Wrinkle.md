### 📜 Description
This spell warps and bends reality, deforming perception and probability. You gain a +1 luck bonus to all die rolls within the reality wrinkle, while other creatures suffer a -1 penalty. The reality wrinkle halves all movement and grants cover and concealment to creatures within it, though your movement, attacks, and perceptions are unimpeded by it. Once the reality wrinkle ends (including if it is dispelled), normal reality collapses onto you and you become entangled. You may attempt a DC 20 Reflex save once per round as a move action to escape this collapsed reality. The DC is reduced by 1 for each round after the firs.

This spell does not function within a forbiddance or dimensional lock. It counters and is countered by dimensional anchor.
