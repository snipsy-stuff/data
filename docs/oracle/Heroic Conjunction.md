### üìú Description
You empower your companions with secrets of stellar conjunctions. This spell allows them to identify the best course of action of all possible outcomes, though they may be helpless to change their fate. But as they move closer, solutions become clearer, and the best possible actions come within their grasp.

As long as a target of the spell is within 30 ft. of at least one other of the spell's target, that creature gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. If the target of the spell is within 5 ft. of at least one other target of the spell, the bonus increases to +2. In addition, once per round as a free action the target can gain an insight bonus to damage equal to its base attack bonus (minimum +1) to a single melee attack. It can choose to apply this bonus after the damage is rolled.
