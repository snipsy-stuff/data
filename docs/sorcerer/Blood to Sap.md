### 📜 Description
This spell causes one target creature's blood to thicken and slow in its veins. An affected creature suffers excruciating pain, taking an immediate 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). In addition, it moves at half its normal speed and it takes a -4 circumstance penalty on Dexterity as its limbs stiffen. At the same time, the creature's skin hardens and becomes more resilient, improving its natural armor bonus by +2. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.) As well, the creature is no longer subject to critical hits and sneak attacks (or other effects that depend on having a discernable anatomy), since its vital organs are effectively shielded by the thickening blood. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and prevents all other effects (even those that could be beneficial). Blood to sap can target only living creatures with a discernable anatomy and a bloodstream. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead (except those with the blood drain ability) are immune to the effects of this spell.
