### üìú Description
You create a tiny mass of unstable blightburn crystal, allowing you to enhance the effect of a transmutation spell or extract you cast or a mutagen you use before the end of your turn through a calibrated emission of blightburn radiation. The companion transmutation spell or extract must be one that affects a living creature and that is normally harmless, and its spell level cannot exceed one-half your caster level. If you do not cast an appropriate transmutation spell by the end of your turn, the unstable isotope becomes disintegrates without effect.

If you use an appropriate companion spell, extract, or mutagen, before the end of your turn, make a Craft (alchemy) check. The spell, extract, or mutagen is enhanced as though your caster level were increased by the result of your Craft (alchemy) check divided by 10 (rounding down). If you roll a natural 1 on this check, the target is exposed to an overdose of blightburn radiation and must save or contract blightburn sickness.

Blightburn Sickness: contact; save Fortitude DC 22; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage and 1d6 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Unstable isotope has no effect if the companion spell, extract, or mutagen targets a creature that is protected by a force effect, including mage armor, shield, or bracers of armor.
