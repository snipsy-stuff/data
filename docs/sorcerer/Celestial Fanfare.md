### 📜 Description
A great blaring of trumpets from on high blasts down upon the area you designate. All evil creatures within the area of effect take 1d6 hp damage per caster level (maximum of 15d6 hp damage) and are blinded and deafened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and reduces the blindness and deafness to 1d4 rounds.

Neutral creatures within the area of effect take half damage and are blinded and deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful save reduces the damage to one-quarter the total and negates the blinding and deafening effects. Good-aligned creatures are not affected by this spell.

Half the damage this spell causes is sonic damage. The other half results directly from divine power and is not reduced by resistance to sonic-based attacks.
