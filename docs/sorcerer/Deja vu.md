### 📜 Description
In an instant, the subject of this spell experiences the ravages of the previous round over again. Only forces that directly deal hit point damage are experienced again. The character receives, in an instant, all the damage he received in the previous round. For example, if the character receives 20 points of fire damage after successfully saving from a fireball and 8 points from a dagger attack, he receives 20 points of fire damage and 8 points of dagger damage when this spell is cast.
