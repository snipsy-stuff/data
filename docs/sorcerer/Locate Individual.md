### 📜 Description
This spell functions as locate creature (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game), except you can attempt to locate an individual not known to you. You can locate any individual within range, provided you have seen the subject at least once and studied him for at least 1 minute, or have a detailed description supplied by someone who knows the subject or has studied him. Your visualization is limited to the subject's appearance at the time you made the study (or as it's described to you), so if the subject you seek has changed his appearance, the spell locates the closest individual that fits the description from which you are working.
