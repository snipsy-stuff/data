### 📜 Description
Lesser ley pulse generates ley-line vibrations within creatures in the burst's area of effect. The pulse removes DR for one type of damage or one type of energy resistance (it does not remove immunities) from the targets for the spell's duration.

The caster must specify the type of removed damage reduction or energy resistance, so familiarity with the targets' defensive abilities via the appropriate Knowledge skill is necessary for effective use of this spell. For instance, you could choose to remove two hezrou demons' resist acid 10 with this spell, making the creatures susceptible to acid, or, you could choose to allow slashing damage to overcome their DR, making it easier for allies to damage them.

Addition from Ley Pulse, Lesser: Greater area, target immunities possibly removed.
