### 📜 Description
You gain darkvision, the ability to see 60 feet even in total darkness, including that created by deeper darkness. Darkvision is black-and-white only, but otherwise like normal sight. While affected, your eyes turn completely black (but appear white to anyone viewing you with darkvision).
