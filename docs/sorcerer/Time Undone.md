### 📜 Description
A bar of liquid light springs from your pointing finger. This ray is not blocked by anything. When it strikes an object, it passes through that object and continues on to the limit of its range. You must make a ranged touch attack against all targets within the ray to its maximum range. All targets within the area of effect take 10 points of damage per caster level. A successful save results in half damage. If the spell slays or destroys the target, it consumes the remains and a creature's soul utterly including any equipment or possessions. That creature can never be resurrected, raised or transformed into undead by any means, including miracle and wish. Only divine intervention from a deity whose portfolio deals with time can restore the creature to life. Artifacts are immune to the effects of this spell. 

There is a greater side effect of using time undone. Any creature or object destroyed with this spell ceases to exist for 24 hours before he was stuck by this spell. That is, if a creature is destroyed, it is as if that creature never existed for the previous 24 hours. Memories of those actions remain, but the actual events of the creature's life during the last 24 hours never occurred. For example, an opponent kills several allies but is later slain by this spell, the allies the opponent killed are later found alive, having a blurred memory of their death and at times others who were witness to their deaths express surprise at seeing them alive.
