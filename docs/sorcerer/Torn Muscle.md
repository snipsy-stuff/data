### 📜 Description
The target immediately gets a sharp cramp in his chest, back or side and becomes short of breath, imposing a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. More importantly, the creature is flat-footed and cannot run. A conjuration (healing) spell of 2nd level or higher negates the effects of this spell, as do fast healing and regeneration.
