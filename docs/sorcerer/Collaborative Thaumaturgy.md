### 📜 Description
You tap into the magical resonance between you and your allies to enhance one another’s magic. Cast this spell when an ally casts a spell at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. The ally casts her spell as if one of the following metamagic feats were applied to it without increasing the spell level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. If the ally is the target of two collaborative thaumaturgy spells when casting a spell, the ally can instead apply the Empower Spell metamagic feat to a spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. Finally, if the ally is the target of three collaborative thaumaturgy spells when casting a spell, she can instead apply the Maximize Spell or Widen Spell metamagic feat to a spell at least 3 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. You can’t target yourself with collaborative thaumaturgy.
