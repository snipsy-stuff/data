### 📜 Description
You blast your enemies with clinging ribbons of shadow. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and inflicts the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, by making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.
