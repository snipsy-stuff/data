### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, it grants you limited protection from projectile weapons and a retaliatory strike against an attacker. You gain damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons; however, this spell does not grant the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction. Additionally, for each projectile weapon that strikes you within a round, a magic missile spell streaks back at the source of the attack, so long as the attacker is within 100 yards. The spell releases a maximum of one magic missile spell each round (4 or 5 missiles). The magic missile is released even if the spell's damage reduction negates all damage inflicted by the projectile weapon, so even nonmagical projectiles elicit the retaliatory magic missile effect.
