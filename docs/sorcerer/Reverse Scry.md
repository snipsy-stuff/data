### 📜 Description
Dragonkin are the race most closely associated with mastery of this spell, although other appropriate races may choose it at the GM's discretion.

Whenever you are the target of a spell with the scrying descriptor or an ability with a scrying effect, you are immediately aware of the attempt. As a swift action, you may target the opposing caster with a greater scrying spell. If you do, reverse scry grants a +5 bonus to overcome the target's spell resistance and imposes a -5 penalty on the target's Will save.
