### 📜 Description
For as long as the subject is under the effects of this spell, he speaks unintelligible gibberish. Among other effects, spellcasters under the effect of unspeakable tongue can still cast spells with verbal components, and can speak magic item command words, but cannot use language-dependent skill checks (such as Diplomacy) which become effectively impossible to make. This effect can be dispelled or negated by a remove curse spell.
