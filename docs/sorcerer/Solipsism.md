### 📜 Description
This spell can only be cast on a non-living object that entirely fits within a 10-ft. cube (a normal door, for example, but not a section of a wall or a very large door). That object flickers in and out of another plane, seeming to disappear and reappear randomly. However, even if it disappears in this way, the rest of the world still operates normally. Ceilings are still supported, swords still hang on an invisible sword rack, etc. At each count of the initiative, there is a 50% chance the object is present, and an identical chance that it is somewhere else. If the object is not present, creatures, objects, attacks, etc. can pass through its space easily. It can appear and disappear several times per round (but it is only necessary to roll to see if it is present on those initiative counts that its location becomes important). 

If a creature or object spends more than one initiative count in the object, such as if a character ends his move in that spot, that creature or object is shunted to the nearest clear spot as the object phases in and out.
