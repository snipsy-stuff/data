### 📜 Description
You instantly shrink a humanoid creature, quartering its height, length, and width, and dividing its weight by four. This changes the creature's size category to Tiny. The target gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity, a -4 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +2 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size.

A Tiny creature has a space of 2 1/2 ft. and a natural reach of 0 ft. (so it must enter an opponent's square to attack). This spell doesn't change the target's speed.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.

Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size and deals normal damage.

When this spell is cast on prisoners, the kobold tradition is to chase them around and attempt to stomp them flat.

This spell counters and dispels ogrekobold.
