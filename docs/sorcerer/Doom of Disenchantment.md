### 📜 Description
When you cast the doom of disenchantment, your armor and shield (if any) glow an unearthly, steady shade of bluish-grey, a light that seems unholy. When any foe strikes you with a weapon or a natural attack augmented by a spell that enhances combat (such as prayer, magic fang, etc.), your doom dispels that augmenting magic or temporarily suppresses the magical abilities of a magic item.

A disenchanted spell ends as if its duration had expired. The magical abilities of an item or a spell that has been made permanent are suppressed for 3 rounds. The doom of disenchantment can dispel (but not counter) spell-like and supernatural effects just as it does spells. Spells with an instantaneous duration can't be disenchanted, because the magical effect is already over before the disenchantment can take effect.

You take damage from the attack normally. Your own armor is never disenchanted by this doom.
