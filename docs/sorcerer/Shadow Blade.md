### üìú Description
You create a blade fashioned from solidified shadow. It can take the form of any one-handed piercing or slashing weapon of your choice, taking on all of the properties of that weapon. For example, in the form of a rapier, the shadow blade deals 1d6 points of piercing damage on a successful hit and scores a critical threat on a roll of 18‚àí20. In any form, it deals an extra 1 point of damage per caster level on any successful strike. You may change its form to a new type of blade once per round as a swift action. You are considered proficient with the shadow blade regardless of its form, but you can also apply any feats or special abilities you have that apply to a specific one-handed weapon when it takes the form of that weapon.

Each round, including the round in which you cast this spell, you may make a melee attack with the shadow blade as a standard action. You resolve these attacks as a melee touch attack using your base attack bonus, but you may use your Intelligence or Charisma modifier rather than your Strength (or Dexterity) modifier. The first time any creature is struck by the shadow blade, it may make a Will save to recognize the blade‚Äôs shadow nature. If the save succeeds, the creature takes only minimum damage from any subsequent successful attack by the blade for the duration of the spell.
