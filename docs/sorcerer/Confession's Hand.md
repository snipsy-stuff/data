### 📜 Description
The subject must hold a pen when the spell is cast, and must have a surface to write on while this spell is in effect. The subject is compelled to hold the pen until the spell ends. If the caster asks the subject a question, he must write a truthful answer to the question. The spell does not prevent unintentional inaccuracies, and the subject may commit lies of omission; the subject must also be literate. A pen must be dipped in ink every few words, which slows the writing process. A short answer to a question usually takes about 30 seconds to write. A long answer may take two minutes or more.
