### 📜 Description
You can manipulate the probability of an action failing or succeeding. This spell creates a 2d10 luck bonus or penalty (caster's choice) to any one d20 roll made by a single creature. If the subject resists and makes a successful saving throw, this results in the bonus or penalty being reduced by half. This spell cannot affect the same creature more than once per day.
