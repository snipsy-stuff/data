### üìú Description
This spell creates a loud, chiming clangor that breaks non-magical objects; sunders a single large, non-magical object; or damages crystalline, stone, and metal creatures.

Used as an area attack, greater shatter destroys all non-magical objects made of crystal, glass, ceramic, brick, stone, or porcelain within a 25-foot radius of the point of origin, smashing them into dozens of pieces. Objects weighing more than 1 lb. per level are not affected.

All creatures within the area of effect must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 round per level. Alternatively, you can target a single object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 1,000 lbs. per level, such as a portion of a bridge, cliff wall, dam, or glacier.

Finally, this spell deals 2d6 hp sonic damage per level (maximum 20d6) to crystalline creatures or constructs of any weight, with a Fortitude save allowed for half damage.
