### 📜 Description
Your eyes burn with a bright, cold light, granting you a gaze attack that inflicts snow blindness on any creature that meets it. Treat this as a normal gaze attack with the effects of snow blindness as detailed in chapter five of Northlands: Roleplaying in Winter's Chill. The first failed saving throw inflicts minor snow blindness. A second inflicts its more severe variety.
