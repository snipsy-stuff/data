### 📜 Description
You pluck out one of your own eyes, while creating a levitating protoplasmic sac to encase it. The act of removing an eye deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the caster and leaves him dazzled until the eyespore is replaced in his eye socket; if the eyespore is destroyed, the dazzled condition becomes permanent, though remove blindness/deafness, regenerate, or heal removes the condition. If you are affected by the countless eyes spell when you cast discharge eyespore, you may choose to discharge the remaining duration of that spell in lieu of taking Constitution damage and becoming dazzled.

The eyespore functions similarly to prying eyes but creates only a single floating oculus. However, the eyespore gains all-around vision and in addition to normal sight has blindsight in a radius equal to 10 feet per 5 caster levels.

The protoplasmic sac encasing the eyespore is filled with unstable gas that allows it to float and propel itself, and if the eyespore is damaged it explodes in a 10-foot radius, dealing 6d6 points of damage (DC 16 Reflex half). In addition, creatures within this blast radius are exposed to blinding sickness.
