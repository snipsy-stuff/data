### 📜 Description
This spell has two potential effects, causing a target either to act like a savage animal or to believe it is a local, dangerous monster.

• Rabid: The target becomes savage, attacking with its teeth, attempting to bite its closest ally (bite 1d2, provokes an attack of opportunity if it does not have a natural bite attack). The subject's Intelligence becomes 2 and it gains a size bonus of +12 to Strength and +8 to Constitution. The target also gains a +5 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 25). The affected creature is unable to cast spells, activate magic items, use spell-like abilities, use class features, understand language, or communicate coherently, it can also only use the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Perception, Stealth, and Swim.

• Monstrous Delusions: Whenever the subject sleeps, the nearest dangerous predator that is at least 3 challenge ratings higher than the target awakens from sleep and begins to travel about hunting. During that time, the subject will dream as if seeing through the creature's eyes; when it is nearly time for the subject to awaken, the monster will seem to have to travel back to where the subject is sleeping. When alone, the subject will often black out, destroy his clothes and other garments, but retain no memory of having done so. GM's are encouraged to use their imagination to help enhance the subject's delusion that he has become a monstrous lycanthrope. 

Those targets fortunate enough to make their Will saves are fascinated for 1 round but are immune to subsequent castings of this spell from the same caster for 24 hours. The subject remains in this mindless state until a greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel the zoanthropy effect.
