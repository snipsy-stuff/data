### 📜 Description
Code skill gives a construct a number of ranks in a single skill equal to those possessed by another creature the caster is touching when the spell is cast. A non-intelligent construct cannot gain the benefits of Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills. The maximum number of ranks a construct can gain by code skill is equal to its Hit Dice.
