### 📜 Description
A small, brightly glowing prismatic meteor darts forth from your fingertips to strike your enemies. Each meteor requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 2d6 hp fire damage. Creatures struck by a meteor are also dazzled for a number of rounds equal to your level. On a critical hit, the target is instead blinded for a number of rounds equal to your level.

For every two levels beyond 5th, you gain an additional meteor-two at 7th level, three at 9th and so on to a maximum of five at 13th level. A target struck by multiple meteors must make saving throws against each to resist the spell's secondary effect (the duration of which does not stack). Sightless creatures are not affected by a prismatic meteor's secondary effect.
