### 📜 Description
Seek the soulless creates a cone of strange magical energy. Within its area, living mortal creatures with souls (all creatures other than undead, constructs, plants, or utsiders) find themselves surrounded by a momentary nimbus of light that protects them from the spell's influence. All those not protected suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Inanimate objects suffer full damage from this blast of energy. This spell proves useful for fighting undead or other creatures without worrying about harming your friends.
