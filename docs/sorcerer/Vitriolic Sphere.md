### 📜 Description
A leathery sphere about the size of a grapefruit appears in your palm, and can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 120 feet. If the sphere is wielded by any other creature, the spell automatically discharges. When the sphere hits, it breaks with an audible pop and releases a cloud of splinters, acidic vapor, and toxic dust. The target struck takes 10d6 points of damage, with no save (half piercing damage, half acid damage). In addition to damage, the burst fills a 15-foot radius with a toxic cloud poisoning all creatures within it (you are immune to this poison). Vitriolic dust - contact; save DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage and blindness; cure 3 consecutive saves.
