### 📜 Description
Casting the spell culminates with the caster kissing the victim full upon the lips and then spitting on him. The spell may be held ready for up to 12 hours, but at the end of that time, if not cast, it is lost. The act of kissing and then spitting on the target represents the absolute proximity of the curse and rejection of the victim - soon to be made manifest by the curse. Vermin creatures flock to the victim, finding comfort in him. 

Flies, gnats, and other vermin creatures make their home in his hair and skin, laying their eggs on him, becoming a constant nuisance and getting into his nose, mouth and eyes. The vermin constantly infect the victim, weakening his immune system and causing a -4 circumstance penalty to any Fortitude saves to resist diseases. 

The cloud of vermin also attracts attention and makes it difficult to see. Any rolls that depend on visual acuity suffer a -4 circumstance penalty including Disable Device and Perception checks, and any ranged attacks. In addition, all Charisma-based checks suffer a -4 circumstance penalty. Also, 2d4 tiny vermin creatures accompany you at all times, often sleeping with the victim at night and may be found in the victim's pockets or equipment. There is a 50% chance every night that the vermin will chew up any paper materials they can access or eat any accessible food. If they begin starving, they attack the victim. They also make sneaking difficult and any Stealth attempts suffer a -4 circumstance penalty. 

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
