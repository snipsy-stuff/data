### 📜 Description
By entering into a deep trance, you can portend another creature's future and provide him with additional insight about what lies ahead of him. Mirrored oracle does not provide the character any specific or even vague knowledge about his future. Instead, the character experiences a strange sense of deja vu throughout the spell's duration. In game terms, this spell gives the character a total insight bonus equal to the caster level that he can add, in partial increments, to his AC or to any die roll including attack and damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks and ability checks even after determining the initial outcome (excluding rolls for hit points). Whenever he applies an insight bonus under any of the preceding circumstances, he subtracts that amount from his remaining insight bonus until it is exhausted. An insight bonus added to his AC only applies to one attack made against him. For instance, a mirrored oracle spell cast by a 17th level cleric grants the recipient a total insight bonus of +17. If the character adds a +5 insight bonus to a saving throw, a +3 insight bonus to an attack roll and a +3 insight bonus to AC, he still has a +6 bonus that he can add to any one die roll or to multiple die rolls as long as the cumulative bonus does not exceed +6. The spell ends when the character has completely exhausted his insight bonus, and the effects of multiple oracle spells do not stack.
