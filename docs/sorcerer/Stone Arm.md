### 📜 Description
You petrify one arm of a foe. The arm becomes unusable. If the arm was holding something, that object is now held fast, requiring a strength check (DC 25) to remove it. The creature is unable to perform any action that requires two hands and suffers a -4 penalty to all dexterity and strength based skill and ability checks due to the unbalancing weight.
