### üìú Description
A warpwall is a transparent barrier that marks a temporary rift between dimensions, visible as a shimmer or distortion in the air (though it doesn't block vision). A warpwall blocks line of effect and any creature or object coming into contact with a warpwall (including ranged weapons and incorporeal creatures) must make a Will save or be instantly transported 1d6 x 5 feet back away from the warpwall, ending its movement and its turn. If the transportation effect would send a corporeal creature to a location already occupied by a solid body, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage and a new distance is rolled as above. If this, too, would place the creature inside a solid body, the creature takes another 1d6 points of damage and ends its turn in its original space. 

Incorporeal creatures transported by a warpwall can wind up inside solid objects, but not inside other creatures. In the former case, the creature's turn ends and it can move normally through the object during its next turn. In the latter case, roll again as above. You can cast a warpwall in two different shapes, as noted below, but each shape must be continuous and cannot be placed so it passes through any object or barrier. You can place a warpwall so it passes through creatures, though with such creatures making immediate Will saves as though they touched the wall (you determine which side of the wall it teleports the creature away from).

‚Ä¢ Vertical Plane: When you cast this version of the spell, you create a perfectly vertical curtain that covers an area of up to two 10-foot squares per caster level. Though the curtain must always be upright, you can shape it by bending it at right angles every 5 feet, but you must have line of effect to all portions of the curtain when you cast the spell. You can make the curtain twice as long (20 feet) by making it half as high (5 feet).

‚Ä¢ Hemisphere: This version of the spell allows you to create a dome with a radius of up to 5 feet per caster level, centered on you.
