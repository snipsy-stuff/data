### 📜 Description
You create a 15-foot-radius emanation centered on the target, which can move if placed on a creature or a movable object. The emanation acts on both earth and fire, creating an area where the two mix in roughly equal portions. Earth within the emanation becomes heated, causing all creatures touching the ground to suffer 6d6 fire damage each round they are in contact with the earth. Fire within the emanation becomes infused with molten lava; damage dealt with the fire descriptor (excluding this spell) deals an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage and entangles the foe as it rapidly cools, hardening to rock, anchoring a foe to its current location (as entangle). 

A successful Reflex save results in half damage and negates the entangled condition.
