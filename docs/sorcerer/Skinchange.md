### 📜 Description
Upon completing this spell, you immediately transfer your consciousness into the body of an animal within range, leaving your body unconscious unless the target animal succeeds on a Will save. Failure to control the target ends the spell. You retain your class and level (or HD) as well as all class abilities derived from that class, and all skill ranks and any other abilities not granted your original physical form (such as darkvision or non-magical flight).

Skinchanging for less than a day incurs no ill effects, but after the first 24 hours you must make a Will save against a DC equal to 10 + the creature's original HD. Failure affects you as if you had failed the second save of a baleful polymorph spell. This save must be made every month thereafter.

In addition, your body still requires sustenance and suffers the effects of starvation and thirst as outlined in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook if left unconscious long enough.
