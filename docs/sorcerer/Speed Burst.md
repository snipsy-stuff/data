### 📜 Description
By spending a standard action compressing and decompressing space, you may act with bursts of speed on the following round. For the first round of this spell's duration and on every odd round thereafter, you must spend a standard action to compress and decompress space from the higher dimensions. On every even round, you are under the effects of a haste spell, and visually you appear to travel twice as far as your movement should carry you.

During rounds you are compressing and decompressing space, you have a 50% chance that space decompresses behind you, allowing you move and act at normal speed. Otherwise, space decompresses in front of you and you are slowed as per the slow spell, except that visually you appear to travel half as far as your movement should carry you.
