### 📜 Description
You shoot forth a flaming, pure white ray that strikes with an appalling and burning heat. A pure white flame begins to burn on the victim's body. If the victim fails a Fortitude save, it suffers 4 points of damage. The victim must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7 rounds total) to avoid suffering an additional 4 points of hit point damage per round. The caster gains 4 temporary hit points whenever this spell deals 4 points of damage. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If a victim is slain by this sell, only blackened ash remains of the victim. Hit points lost to the lifefire ray never heal naturally and can only be magically restored by a 9th level conjuration (healing) spell that also requires a successful caster level check (DC 15+ your caster level). Fast healing and regeneration are also ineffective against the damage dealt by this spell. Creatures that can only be killed under specific conditions are immune to this spell.
