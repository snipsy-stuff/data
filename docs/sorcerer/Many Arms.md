### 📜 Description
This spell causes the target creature to sprout an additional 1 arm per 3 caster levels (maximum 6 additional arms). In addition, the target's clothes and armor alter themselves to allow these new arms to function without penalty. If the target's hands ended in natural weapons such as claws, the new arms have similar natural attack forms. These additional arms allow the target to make additional attacks as part of a full round action, with all new arms allowing secondary attacks. If the target creature has the Two- Weapon Fighting feat, then it is treated as having the multiweapon mastery ability and never takes penalties to its attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons for the duration of the spell.
