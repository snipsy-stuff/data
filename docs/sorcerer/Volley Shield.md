### 📜 Description
This spell brings into existence an invisible, moving shield with a reflective surface that can absorb damage from incoming spells, projectile weapons, and melee weapons. The shield grants the target DR 15/magic. The shield remains in effect for its duration or until it prevents 15 hp damage/level. When it absorbs this maximum amount of damage, the shield immediately dissipates.

The shield can also volley spells back to their originator. When the target is the subject of an opposing spell, it must make a saving throw as normal. If this save succeeds, the shield successfully volleys the spell back to its original caster. The returned spells' range, duration, saving throw, and other components remain unchanged. The original caster receives the appropriate saving throw versus the returned spell and suffers any ill effects the spell might cause.
