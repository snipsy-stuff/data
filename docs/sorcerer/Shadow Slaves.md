### 📜 Description
Upon casting this spell, you begin to vomit forth 1d3 shadows (see Pathfinder Bestiary). The shadows are completely under your control You take a point of Strength damage for each shadow vomited, as negative energy pains wrack your body, and you are also nauseated the next round.

These shadows move and attack on your initiative, but they cannot travel more than 100 ft. beyond you. If one of the shadows moves past this limit due to your movement or its movement, it dissipates instantly.

These shadows do not count toward the maximum number of undead you can control. Shadows summoned in this manner can be dispelled by dispel magic effects and can be harmed by channeled negative energy as usual.
