### üìú Description
You create a coruscating ball of swirling multicolored energy that drops from above and lands where directed, only to bounce back into the air. Each round, bouncing boom drops to the surface, then bounces up again. When it lands each round, it deals 5d6 damage of a different energy type to all creatures in a 20-foot radius burst. You can select any one of the standard five energy types but you must select a different energy type each round, and you cannot repeat an energy type for the duration of the spell. After the first round (where you determine the point where the ball drops), determine the ball's bouncing direction; you can have it land anywhere along that straight path up to 30 feet before it detonates again (it must move a minimum of 5 feet). If the ball hits an obstruction, such as a wall, tree, or person, it detonates there and then moves along a 5-foot path, though after detonating there it can bounce and clear a 10-foot tall obstruction before moving along that 5-foot path. Repeat this process each round for a total of 5 rounds. Bouncing boom is considered to have the energy descriptor appropriate to the type of damage it is currently dealing. It has no descriptor the instant it is being cast.
