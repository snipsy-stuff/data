### 📜 Description
You call on the wisdom of the runes and sky to provide you with guidance. Sometimes, a white feather of insight falls into your hands; more often, the world remains mysterious.

Roll 1d20 and add your Wisdom bonus to the roll (ravenfolk gain a +1 racial bonus to this roll). On a result of 20 or better, the GM provides you with some obscure but useful piece of advice that will apply to your character in the next 24 hours On a roll of less than 20, the GM provides some other bit of wisdom that is largely useless to adventuring ("Be kind to animals" or "The GM would like a beverage").

On an unmodified roll of 1, the caster must make a Will saving throw. If it fails, you lose 1 prepared spell or spell slot for 24 hours This is a spell of the highest-level slot you know.

Unlike most cantrips, a caster may cast Drink deep from Mimir's well just once per day.
