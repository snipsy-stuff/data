### 📜 Description
For the duration of this spell, you are able to convert spell energy into searing rays of raw, primordial force by sacrificing prepared spells or unused spell slots of 1st level or higher and channeling them into blasts of raw vril.

This ray resolves as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 30 ft. This attack deals 1d6 hp damage per spell level sacrificed +1 per level. Alternatively, the blast heals 2 hp for every level of the sacrificed spell or spell slot +1 per level. 0-level spells cannot be converted in this manner.
