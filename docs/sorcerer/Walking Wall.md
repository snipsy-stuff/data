### 📜 Description
This spell creates a monstrous wall of swinging axes from the pile of miniature axes you use in the casting of the spell. The wall takes on a vaguely humanoid shape, stands 10 ft. tall, and has a space and reach of 10 ft. You direct the wall as a move action, but it will continue executing any command you gave it previously if you choose not to direct it.

The wall has a base speed of 50 ft. (it cannot run or charge), and it can make a total of four attacks per round. Each axe deals damage as a Large battleaxe (1d10/x3) and attacks with an attack bonus equal to your level plus your Charisma and Intelligence modifier (whichever is greater) minus 1 (for its Large size). The axe wall has hardness 20 and 200 hp.
