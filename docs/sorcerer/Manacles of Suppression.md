### 📜 Description
You wrap the target in unbreakable magical chains that not only bind with the strength of real chains but suppress any active spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Further, this spell keeps the target from activating any new spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities, or being affected by those that others cast. It is as if the victim were in his own personal antimagic field. You may use manacles of suppression as actual grapples, though you must make a successful grapple check (CMB equals your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier); the manacles suppress any magical defenses against grapples, such as freedom of movement or deflection bonuses to CMD. You can attempt to pin the opponent as a move action; you can also maintain the grapple or the pin as a move action. This spell does not suppress itself, though an antimagic field would suppress it.
