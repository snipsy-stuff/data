### 📜 Description
This spell surrounds the target with a hemisphere, exactly half of which is lit as by a daylight spell and half of which is as dark as a deeper darkness. Initially, the illuminated section is directly in front of the target and moves to correspond with his facing. He may choose to rotate the facing of the light and dark sections as a move-equivalent action, making up to one full rotation per round. If cast on an object, the caster can control the facing of the sections. Neither daylight nor deeper darkness will dispel light before, darkness behind, but this spell will dispel either daylight or deeper darkness.
