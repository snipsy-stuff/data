### 📜 Description
A brilliant ray of crackling electricity streaks from your outstretched finger, leaving behind the smell of ozone. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of nonlethal electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Creatures immune to nonlethal damage or to electricity are immune to this spell. Creatures with resistance to electricity apply twice their normal resistance to the damage dealt by this spell.
