### 📜 Description
This spell creates a self-renewing font of invisible energies in a single 5-foot square you designate when casting the spell. Any creature beginning its turn in this space becomes invisible, as invisibility. This invisibility{/ ends if an affected creature attacks, as normal for the spell, but if the creature returns to the invisibility well and begins a turn in the area it becomes invisible again. Creatures larger than Medium that occupy the space of the invisibility well with a portion of their body become invisible at the beginning of their turn.

When the invisibility well expires or is dispelled, all creatures lose their invisibility immediately; otherwise, the invisibility that each creature gains from the invisibility well functions independently, and one creature can lose its invisibility (whether by attacking or being dispelled) without affecting the invisibility that other creatures have gained from the invisibility well. Creatures using the same invisibility well cannot see each other.

If the invisibility well is dispelled, the crystal bowl focus shatters. This does not occur if the invisibility well is temporarily suppressed by an antimagic field or similar effect. You can move the invisibility well by taking the focus item to a new location and concentrating for 1 full round.
