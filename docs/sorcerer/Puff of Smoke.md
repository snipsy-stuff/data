### 📜 Description
This cantrip creates a puff of smoke. If the smoke bursts in front of a single creature, it must make a Reflex save. If it fails, anything the creature attacks gains concealment against it, and its attacks have a 20% chance to miss. Sightless and blinded creatures, as well as creatures from which you are already concealed, are not affected.
