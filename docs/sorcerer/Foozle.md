### 📜 Description
The subjects of this spell become so clumsy and oafish they find it exceedingly difficult to undertake most actions without error, taking a -5 penalty on all attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks. Whenever an affected creature fails an attack or skill check that involves a manufactured weapon or tool, if must make a Reflex save or drop it. An affected creature can move at only up to one-half its normal speed without having to make a Reflex save to avoid falling prone. 

In cases where a skill check also involves movement (such as climbing, acrobatics, or swimming), ignore the speed restriction but apply the check penalty noted above. If a creature falls prone for any reason while affected by this spell, it must make a Reflex save to get up again. An affected creature must make a Reflex save to draw a weapon, pick up a dropped item, retrieve a stored item, and the like. If the save fails, the creature drops the item in its space. To cast a spell, an affected creature must succeed on a Concentration check with a DC equal to 10+your caster level. If the check fails, the creature loses the spell with no effect. Whenever foozle prevents a creature from completing an action, the creature's turn ends.
