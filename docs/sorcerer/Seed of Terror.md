### 📜 Description
Select a creature as you extract a dream of terror from the Ethereal Plane and implant it into the psyche of your target. This creature's CR cannot be more than three less than your caster level. If successfully implanted, the seed of terror "germinates" over the course of the subject's waking day. During this time, the subject becomes more and more sleepy. Any time between the time seed of terror is cast and when the subject falls asleep, the seed of terror can be purged with a wish, miracle, or other extreme spell effect. When the subject next falls asleep, the seed of terror hatches. (Having already failed her saving throw, the target succumbs to sleep a maximum of eight hours after seed of terror is cast - possibly sooner if she naps or becomes the target of a sleep-inducing spell.) The subject's skin bulges and rips wide, revealing that her inner tissues have become a writhing clot resembling the chosen creature. The subject suffers 3d6 points of Constitution damage. The creature immediately grows to full form and proceeds to act normally as it is not under the control of the caster. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent you from implanting a seed of terror.
