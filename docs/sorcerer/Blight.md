### 📜 Description
This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and may attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.
