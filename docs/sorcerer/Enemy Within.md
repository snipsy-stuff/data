### 📜 Description
You spit out a curse and point to the target, which receives a Will save. If it fails, the target feels and sees a swarm of terrifying insects crawling under its skin (the specific insects vary by target, but could include ants, bees, centipedes, or any insects that particularly frighten the target). These insects deal 3d6 hp damage each round; each round the target would take damage, it receives a Fortitude save to halve the damage.

A target affected by this spell may spend a full-round action slashing at its skin (with a weapon or otherwise) to release the illusory insects; if it does so, this spell ends, but the target takes damage equal to 2d6 + its Strength modifier. The target does not take damage from the insects during the round it spends slashing its skin.
