### 📜 Description
You conjure a night sky 20 ft. above your head (or just below the ceiling, if the ceiling is lower than 20 ft. high) replete with twinkling stars. This area of effect moves with you. Once per round, you can call down a falling star to strike enemies within the area of affect. The star requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 5d6 hp bludgeoning damage. In subsequent rounds, you can use a standard action to call down another star. You may call down a number of stars equal to your level (maximum 10).

Cast outside during daylight, star fall reduces the light level by one step in the area of effect.
