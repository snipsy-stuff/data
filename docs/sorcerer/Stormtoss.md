### 📜 Description
You use air or magical force (caster's choice) to pick up multiple non-magical unattended objects within range and violently thrust them toward one target within range. The object or objects deal 5d6 + 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every two levels you possess (max 15d6) to one target. If the target possesses damage reduction 5, hardness 5 or more than cannot be overcome by bludgeoning damage and the material type of the unattended objects, the target is immune to this spell. You can pick up objects equal to 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 500 pounds at 20th level). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit the target. If there are no unattended objects in the spell's range, the spell fails. Casters often carry small bags of cold iron ingots, alchemic silver-treated bars, and sometimes even adamantine ingots; in a pinch even a bag of copper coins will do.
