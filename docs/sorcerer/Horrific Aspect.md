### 📜 Description
By means of this spell, the caster changes his appearance to that or a horrifying humanoid monster, complete with skeletal head, burning eyes, and wicked claws and fangs. So unnerving and convincing is the illusion, which includes visual, audible, tactile, and thermal components, that it has the following effects on creatures within 30 feet who see the caster. Based on the result of the saving throw, effects occur in descending order and do not stack.

Result of Save                    Effect on Creature 
Failure by 10 or more       Cowering 
Failure by 5 or more         Panicked 
Failure                                  Frightened 
Successful                         Shaken for 1 round

Those entering the area during the spell's duration must make a save, but creatures that make their save and later reenter the spell's area do not have to make a new save.
