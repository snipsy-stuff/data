### 📜 Description
You can control the actions of any construct by vocal or mental commands. Once you give a command, the construct attempts to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities.

Changing your instructions or giving a construct a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell as a standard action, you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the construct. Intelligent constructs resist the mechanical control, and any construct forced to take actions against its nature receives a save with a +2 bonus.

Self-destructive orders are not carried out and immediately end the spell. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
