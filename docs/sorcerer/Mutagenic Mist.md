### 📜 Description
You create a bank of multihued mist that shifts constantly in color and turgidity, obscuring vision as fog cloud. Creatures within the mist take a -2 on saving throws against spells or effects of the polymorph subschool. In addition, any creature beginning its turn within the mutagenic mist is affected as fleshcurdle, acquiring a randomly determined deformity (equal chance of offense, defense, or movement, rolling randomly to determine the specific deformity if a creature possesses more than natural weapon or more than one form of movement). A creature failing multiple saves can acquire multiple deformities from the mutagenic mist. These deformities remain for 2d6 rounds after a creature leaves the mutagenic mist.
