### 📜 Description
You imbue the target ink with powerfully poisonous energy. If used during the duration, the ink produces writing permeated with the energy. This effect becomes permanent once the ink of the writing has dried. At the time of casting, you may designate up to one unique creature per caster level as immune to the script's effects. Anything written with the ink after the duration expires is normal script. Once the ink dries, anyone reading the text other than you or a designated creature is immediately exposed to the poison similar to the green effect of a prismatic spray. The poison has a Fortitude save DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your key ability modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; initial effect death; secondary effect 1 Constitution damage/round; cure 2 consecutive saves. Merely looking at the text does not trigger the effect. It is only triggered if the creature actually reads the writing. Some shady spellcasters have been known to write their spellbooks entirely in forbidden script.
