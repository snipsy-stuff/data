### 📜 Description
With this spell you magically enhance stones, such that when you throw them, they transform into giant boulders, similar to those hurled by stone giants. You treat these as light thrown weapons with which you are proficient. These boulders deal 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage plus your caster ability modifier. The boulders have a range increment of 60 feet and can be thrown up to 5 range increments. The boulders strike as bludgeoning weapons, rather than spells, and are considered magic weapons for purposes of damage reduction. The stones can be enhanced with spells as though they were projectiles. Once a stone strikes (or misses) its target, the magic within it is discharged, and the stone reverts to normal.
