### 📜 Description
This spell is like a contagion spell, but it affects only herd animals such as horses, cows, and centaurs. Using this kind of magic against a clan or a tribe's herds is a crime punishable by severe torture and death. Only the most black-hearted and ruthless of witches and wizards dare to use it.
