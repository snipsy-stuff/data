### 📜 Description
With a touch, you cause a creature to appear as an adult dragon of a type of your choosing. If the target is already an adult dragon or older, you can make the target to appear one age category older than its current age. You can attempt to make the target appear as a specific dragon; the target receives a +10 bonus to Disguise checks for this purpose. Direct interaction with the target allows creatures to make a Will save to see through the spell.
