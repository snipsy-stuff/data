### 📜 Description
Whenever two or more parties enter into a binding, written contract, this spell enables all of the parties to instantaneously become aware of a breach in that contract as long as the offender and the affected parties are on the same plane of existence. The spell only affects willing participants that have signed the contract and is typically employed as a means of ensuring trustworthiness rather than enforcing the terms of the contract. At the time of the casting, all of the willing participants that signed the contract must be within the same enclosed space as the contract. (The exclusion of unwilling participants does not negate the spell.) From that point forward, all of the spell's recipients receive a brief, visual image showing the individual that broke the terms of the contract, and how he violated the terms of the agreement. Alternatively, a recipient can dismiss the spell's effects upon him at any time, although all of the remaining recipients become aware of his action as if he violated the contract. The GM has sole discretion when determining if the spell's conditions have been met and the precise nature of the information provided by the spell.
