### 📜 Description
Air ripples as a wave of crushing force bears down on your targets, crushing them mercilessly as if they were hundreds of feet under the sea. All targets take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). In addition, victims that fail their save are permanently deafened. Creatures immune to critical hits or bludgeoning damage and creatures with the aquatic subtype are immune to the effects of this spell.
