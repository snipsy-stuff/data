### 📜 Description
With a command and a complex gesture, you cause one or more constructs to stop. You render up to three constructs immobile and helpless. The constructs are entitled to a new saving throw each round as a fullround action to break free from the spell's effects. The effect is broken if the halted creatures are attacked or take damage.
