### üìú Description
You hurl a blob of undefined goo at the target. Inorder to properly hit, you must first succeed at a ranged touch attack. Once a target has been successfully struck, the blob erupts into one of the five energy types (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) at random and deals 4d6 points of damage of the determined energy type. 

On the following round the energy blob continues to deal damage. The energy type dealt by the blob will remain the same unless the target is immune to that form energy, is resistant to that form of energy, or regenerates damage dealt by that form of energy. If the target is negating the effects in any of the above fashions, then the blob changes to a different form of energy chosen randomly from the remaining choices. If the creature is also immune to, resists, or regenerates the new energy form, it once again switches next round. The type of energy continues to change every round until it finds a form that the target is not immune to, resists, or regenerates. No from will be repeated until all have been tried. 

If the blob shifts through every energy type and does not find any that meet the conditions, it switches to the most effective type of energy. Damage that is not regenerated is always considered more effective, even if it has a higher resistance. Lower resistances are more effective then higher ones. Immunities are completely ineffective, and if the target is immune to all forms of energy, the spell will terminate itself after trying all energy forms. 

Smart blob is considered to have the energy descriptor appropriate to the type of damage it is currently dealing. So a smart blob currently dealing fire damage is considered to have the fire descriptor, but if it changes to dealing acid damage the next round, it no longer has the fire descriptor and instead has the acid descriptor. It has no descriptor the instant it is being cast.
