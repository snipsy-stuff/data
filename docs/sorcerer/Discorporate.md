### 📜 Description
A thin, red ray springs from your pointing finger, causing the creature or object it strikes to glow and slowly disassemble. Discorporating inflicts 10 points of damage per round as particles that comprise the target fall away. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely discorporated, leaving nothing behind. not even dust. A discorporated creature's equipment is unaffected. The ray leaves a 5-foot hole in force effects such as a wall of force and deals damage to spells such as forceful hand. Damage inflicted upon an object ignores hardness. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save takes no damage, but a new save is required each round.

The spell can affect only the first creature or object struck (that is, the ray affects only one target per casting) and continues to affect the creature until the spell ends or is dispelled.
