### 📜 Description
The target is temporarily teleported away in a random direction to a random distance (roll 1d8 north, north east, east, etc.) and a random distance (d100 x caster level feet). The teleported creature or object appears in as safe an area as possible, so it is simply inconvenienced, not endangered (assuming the world has places that could qualify; if cast in the Plane of Fire, for example, anywhere would be dangerous). At the end of the spell's duration, the targeted creature is returned to the exact spot from which it was dispatched. If the spot it was in is occupied, the target appears in the nearest open space.
