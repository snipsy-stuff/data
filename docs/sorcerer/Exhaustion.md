### 📜 Description
The subject of this spell becomes exhausted. An exhausted character moves at half normal speed and suffers a -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After one hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. Since this spell is instantaneous, the effect cannot be dispelled. Spells that relieve exhaustion will work normally on the subject.
