### 📜 Description
This spell creates a number of force bolts, similar to the magic missile spell. However, these bolts deal 1d6+1 damage (maximum 15d6+15). In addition it pushes the target back as per a bull rush (but 10 ft.) for each bolt that strikes the target. If the save is failed by 5 or more, the target falls prone as well. A successful save results in half damage and negates the bull rush effect. The caster need only see some portion of an individual to target him. If the target hits another individual, wall, or other obstacle when pushed back, he automatically falls prone and is considered to have initiated a bull rush against any creature struck.
