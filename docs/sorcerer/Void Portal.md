### 📜 Description
The target designated by this spell, which must be unoccupied by creature or object, becomes a vortex and inexorably draws creatures and objects into its grasp. At the end of the round in which the spell is cast, all creatures and objects within 20 feet of the target who fail their save are moved via the force of gravity 10 feet closer to the target. At the end of the round after the spell is cast, all creatures and objects within 30 feet of the target (including those in the original area of effect) who fail their save are moved 20 feet closer to the target. At the end of every subsequent round, the affected area expands by 10 feet and the distance moved increases by 10 feet (on the fourth round, all creatures and objects within 50 feet who fail their saving throw are moved 40 feet toward the target, etc.). This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Unlike normal circumstances, allies can use this attack of opportunity to grab and hold an ally, which grants an additional save (with a +2 bonus from aid another); failure by 5 or more results in the ally doing the holding also being forced to make a second save. 

Any creature or object that enters the target area immediately takes 10d6 hit points of damage and is plane shifted to a plane of absolute void (no air, gravity, heat etc.). There is no save against the effects of entering the target area.
