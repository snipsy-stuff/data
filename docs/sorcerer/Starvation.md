### 📜 Description
You cause all living creatures in range to become gripped with incredible pangs of hunger, as if they haven’t eaten for days. Creatures affected by this spell are sickened for the duration. In addition, the targets must succeed on a Constitution check against the spell’s DC each round or be nauseated for 1 round. Any time a creature takes a move action to eat while affected (provoking attacks of opportunity), it gains a +1 bonus to its Constitution checks against the spell for the rest of the duration. Bonuses from eating for multiple rounds stack.
