### 📜 Description
You trace a glowing, animated glyph in the air before you with arcane inks that vaporize almost instantly. The resulting glyph hovers near your body and intercedes against physical attacks. This esoteric symbol grants you DR 5/piercing. Once the glyph has prevented a total of 5 hp damage/caster level (maximum 50 hp), it fades away and the spell is discharged.
