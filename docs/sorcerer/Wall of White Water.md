### üìú Description
A vertical curtain of turbulent water appears in unoccupied squires. It is 5 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring rushing wall akin to stormy waters or white water rapids; no creature can pass the barrier without making three consecutive Swim checks (DC = 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier). On a failed check, the victim is swept away and to the top of the wall; if there is a barrier at the top of the wall, such as a ceiling, the creature is pinned by the force of the water (CMB or Escape Artist check DC = 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier to escape this pin effect). In addition, there is loose debris within the water, branches, twigs logs, rocks, and boulders that deal 8d6 points of damage per round to creatures within the wall (no save). Pulling out a character trapped by the water pressure can be difficult. A rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim. He must then make a DC 15 Strength check to successfully pull the victim, and the victim must make a DC 10 Strength check to hold onto the branch, pole, or rope. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety. 

Ranged weapons, including boulders and siege engines, projectiles and other massive ranged weapons are also affected; they are unable to shoot through the wall. As well, gases, breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures). The wall offers total concealment, blocking line of sight and line of effect. 

While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls of white water to enclose specific points. 

Freedom of movement still requires the successful Swim checks to navigate the barrier as this is normal movement through stormy waters, the subject cannot be pinned, but is still subject to the damage.
