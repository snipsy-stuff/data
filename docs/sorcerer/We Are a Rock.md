### 📜 Description
This spell covers a number of Small or Medium humanoids of up to your level with a specific glamer of either a large boulder or a pile of rubble or trash (caster's choice). The boulder or trash is of an appropriate type for the terrain and situation. This spell grants a +20 to Stealth as long as the waiting creature takes no actions of any type, including free actions.  Typically, ambushers have their weapons drawn when the spell is cast. If the illusion is touched or is the target of a spell, effect or attack, anyone able to see this interaction gains a Will save to disbelieve.
