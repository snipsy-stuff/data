### 📜 Description
You may magically investigate one subject and receive a full and detailed explanation, but if you reveal the information, you alter reality to your detriment. You and your GM have a discussion about an aspect of your current adventure; this can be as simple as who the current end villain is, or as complex as a detailed explanation of the current plot. The GM offers a complete and perfectly accurate answer that is in no way cryptic, but if the subject is not related to the original query, the GM is not required to reveal that information.

If the caster's player ever reveals any of the details of this insight to another player, or if the caster ever reveals any of the details of this insight to another character (PC or NPC - subject to GM adjudication), the caster is destroyed as if never having existing and reality is altered so that the information relayed is in some way vitally inaccurate and the truth is far more deadly and dangerous.

You cannot learn any information about a creature subject to the effects of a mind blank though you could learn all about those creatures or objects not protected by the spell.
