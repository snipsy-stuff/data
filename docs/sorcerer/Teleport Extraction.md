### 📜 Description
This spell teleports a vital organ out from inside the body of a living creature. The subject suffers 2d6 points Constitution damage, plus 2 points of Constitution damage per round, and is helpless. A greater restoration, miracle, regenerate, or wish spell is required to negate this damage. A successful save results in the victim suffering only 2 points of Constitution damage (as the spell instead teleports a non-vital organ) and negates the helpless condition. After suffering this damage, a subject that succeeded on the saving throw is immune to teleport extraction spells from the same caster for 24 hours.
