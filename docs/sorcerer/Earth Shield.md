### 📜 Description
This spell wreathes in hard, rocky earth that increases your natural armor by 4. The earthen armor also renders you immune to unarmed/nonlethal and normal ranged attacks (siege weapon attacks affect you normally, but must penetrate a hardness of 15 first). Your base speed is reduced by 10 ft. for the duration of the spell (minimum 5 ft./round), but you suffer no Dexterity penalty or spell failure chance.
