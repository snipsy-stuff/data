### üìú Description
You summon four, tiny, rough stones plus one additional stone for every three caster levels. The conjured stones always float in the air within 3 feet of you. Upon casting, the stones take up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from your body. Each stone leaves behind a trail of glowing light, as if it were a miniature, streaking meteor. Each stone protects you against physical ranged and melee attacks by interposing itself between you and an attack. Each stone can take up to 8 points of damage for you before disintegrating. A 7th-level caster with six stones can take up to 48 points of damage before her shield erodes completely. This orrery of protection does not hinder touch attacks. This effect stacks with similar effects produced by other spells, including stoneskin. The stones offer their protection until expended, until the spell's duration expires, or unless each is grasped or netted to separate it from you. Each stone has an AC of 18. Once captured, a stone dissipates and may not be reactivated. 

In addition, as a move action, you can direct one of your circling sentries to streak away from its protective circuit and attack a foe. You may direct only one such stone of your veil in this fashion each round. 

A commanded stone can be directed to attack any one target within your line of sight as if you were making a ranged touch attack. If successful, it deals 3d6 points of fire damage, and 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage.
