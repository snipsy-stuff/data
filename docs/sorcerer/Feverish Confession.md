### 📜 Description
You touch a creature with a ghoul's claw, and if it fails a Will save it confesses everything it knows about any topic you desire. A creature that makes a successful Will save is immune to this spell's effects for 24 hours

Unlike a charm person or suggestion spell, this spell does not enable you to suggest a course of action to a creature. However, the creature will tell you its weaknesses, where its treasure is hidden, who its enemies are, what its plans are, and where its friends might be. Regardless of its alignment or wishes, the creature pours forth all information that might be valuable.

An affected creature makes no evasions or omissions when confessing its knowledge; on the contrary, it is compelled to add any detail that might be relevant to the caster's subject. In other words, this spell is a perfect confession of that creature's entire state of mind. As a form of extreme magical compulsion, its use is forbidden by faiths of lawful good alignment, and paladins and clerics of such faiths find it repellant.
