### 📜 Description
Creatures of the same size (all Medium, all Large, etc.) within 20 ft. of you are disguised as a single type of creature or object of your choosing. The illusionary forms must be of roughly the same size as the creatures affected. For example, a group of dwarves could be disguised to resemble a flock of sheep (Medium-sized creatures) or as Medium-sized piles of snow.

A DC 20 Perception check reveals that something seems strange about the group-the creatures move oddly or the objects looks strangely similar-and keen-eyed observers can make a Will save to see through the illusion. Only sight is affected by this glamer; strange sounds or other uncharacteristic actions also grant a Will save. Any hostile action by the spell recipients ends the spell immediately.
