### 📜 Description
You grant low-light vision to the affected creatures. Creatures that already have low-light vision have their existing low-light vision enhanced so that they can see four times as far in conditions of dim light. Creatures within 10 feet of someone under the effects of brightest night do not gain concealment from dim light.
