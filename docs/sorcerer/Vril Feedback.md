### 📜 Description
You convert an enemy's destructive spell energy into a vril reservoir from which you can temporarily draw to power your own abilities. You can cast this spell as an immediate action after successfully saving against a single-target spell or a ray directed at yourself or your gear. When you do, you absorb that hostile spell's energy into your body.

You store this energy for 1 round, and during that time you can use it to power any vril-based special abilities you can use, rather than sacrificing your own prepared spell slots. Use the absorbed spell's level to calculate the ability's effects. You can absorb, but not expend, spell energy of levels greater than those you are capable of casting. The spell level you can harness and expend through your vril-based ability is limited by the highest-level spell slot or prepared spell you can cast,

Any additional energy absorbed from spell slots of higher level than you can cast immediately dissipates. In any case, all the absorbed energy dissipates after 1 round if not used.
