### 📜 Description
This spell can be used to change the shape of any shadow, allowing you to depict an outline of your choosing accurately. The total area covered by the shadow is unchanged, although if resize shadow is cast on the shadow immediately before shadow shape, you can shape the resized shadow until the duration of the former spell ends. Shadow shape can cause 1d6 hp damage/level (maximum 5d6) against any one shadow-based creature or illusion that fails its saving throw.
