### 📜 Description
You alter a target's body so that it exudes a thick pink gel, forming a layer over its skin and clothing. Target creatures gain the ability to breathe water freely, as if under the effects of a water breathing spell (but are not prevented from breathing air). In addition, each target creature gains a 30 foot swim speed and a +8 bonus on all Swim checks made to resist hazards. While under the effects of this spell, a target creature can take a run action while swimming, so long as it swims in a straight line. When you cast this spell, you may affect several creatures, dividing the spell's duration evenly among all the creatures you touch.
