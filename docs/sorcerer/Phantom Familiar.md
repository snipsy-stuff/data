### 📜 Description
You make your familiar - including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment  -  look different. It can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You can change its apparent creature type to any magical beast or animal. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or have it look like an entirely different creature. You can change this appearance as a standard action. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile or audible properties of it or its equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, the familiar gets a +10 bonus to its Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.
