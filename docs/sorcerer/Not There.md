### 📜 Description
The target becomes invisible, and in addition gains a limited ability to flicker almost out of existence, becoming a living invisible illusion by concentrating. At any point during the spell, the target can concentrate as a standard action, becoming incorporeal until the beginning of the target’s next turn. Each round she becomes incorporeal in this fashion uses 1 minute of the spell’s duration. The spell ends immediately if the target attacks, as invisibility.
