### 📜 Description
Pure sight duplicates the effects of several lesser divinations, allowing the caster a great chance of detecting anything that is amiss in the area. While pure sight lasts, the caster can change its effect as a free action on his turn once per round, choosing from the following effects: arcane eye, clairvoyance, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, detect poison, detect scrying, detect secret doors, detect undead or see invisibility. While this spell is in effect, a pale, magical light surrounds the caster's eyes, conferring the constant effects of a darkvision spell. These effects call for saving throws as normal, but the DC is based on the pure sight spell. 

In addition, as long as at least one hour remains in pure sight's duration, the caster can change its detection ability to duplicate the effects of arcane true seeing. This effect will last for one hour, cannot be changed and ends the pure sight spell immediately after the hour has elapsed.
