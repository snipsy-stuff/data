### 📜 Description
This spell renders its target incapable of speech. It is not physiological so much as a localized area around the target's mouth (or mouths) from which no sound is able to be emitted. Thus, the target cannot grunt or otherwise produce verbal sounds of any sort, although it still may make sounds such as walking, snapping fingers, or clapping. This prevents any sort of spellcasting that requires verbal components.
