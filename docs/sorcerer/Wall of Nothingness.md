### üìú Description
You create a wall of utter nothingness torn from the very outer rim of the galaxy. The wall cannot be moved or damaged. Any unattended object passing through the wall is automatically destroyed. Creatures passing through a wall of nothingness take 2d6 hp damage per level (maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hp by the wall is entirely disintegrated, leaving nothing behind. Any creature that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected and suffers 10d6 hp damage. If this reduces a creature to 0 hp it is entirely disintegrated, requiringresurrection or a more powerful spell to bring it back to life.

Spells such as dispel magic can remove a wall of nothingness. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If any object or creature breaks the wall's surface, the spell fails.

A wall of nothingness blocks line of sight and line of effect.

A wall of nothingness can be made permanent with a permanency spell. This costs 25,000 gp and requires minimum level 16th.
