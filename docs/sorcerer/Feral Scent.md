### 📜 Description
You change the scent of a creature to match your own, imbuing the creature with your smell for the duration of the spell. This scent overrides the creature's own scent so that any creature tracking by means of the scent feat assumes the creatures being tracked is you. The scent is as strong as your own, but a creature tracking both can differentiate the host from the subject by the strength of the scent with a Perception check (DC 20+1/level).
