### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of multiple swarms simply by forming the thoughts of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: these swarms. Only the spell's subjects can see the phantasmal swarms of ruin. You see only vague shapes. Each target first gets a Will save to recognize the images as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject and the subject must succeed on a second Will save or is afflicted with the nauseated condition from fear and suffers 3d6 points of damage. If the second Will save is successful, the subject suffers the sickened condition for the duration of the spell but the damage is negated. 

If a subject of phantasmal swarms of ruin succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the spell can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
