### 📜 Description
The spell causes a construct's fists to transform into rugged, unpolished metal, growing to roughly the size of a humanoid's head, and crackle with electricity. While under this spell's effect, the target construct's fists deal 1d10 hp bludgeoning damage (1d6 hp for Small constructs) and 1d8 hp electricity damage. Treat the fists as secondary natural weapons. If applicable, the target's unarmed strikes do not provoke attacks of opportunity while this spell is active.

Typically, only gearforged can choose this spell, although other appropriate races may choose it at the GM's discretion.
