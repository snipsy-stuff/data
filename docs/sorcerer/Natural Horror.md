### 📜 Description
You strengthen a creature's wings, tail, or any other existing appendage that can provide a secondary attack so that it does provide that attack. The appendage must be selected when this spell is cast.

The target may attack with the transformed appendage as a secondary attack, which does base damage per Table 3-1 in the Pathfinder Bestiary. Alternatively, this spell may improve an existing secondary attack to deal damage as if the target were one size larger.
