### 📜 Description
You trace a wildly animated glyph in the air and make a ranged touch attack to strike your target. If the attack misses, use the misdirected thrown splash weapon rules to determine where the glyph lands.

On a successful attack, the glyph attaches itself to a randomly determined written work on the target (or the nearest target to where the glyph lands) and replaces every word with non-magical copies of itself in one full round. If another unaffected written work is within 5 ft. of its first target, the glyph jumps to that work to begin anew.

If no unaffected work remains within range, or any target successfully saves, the spell ends. The glyph only affects mundane works or magic items with a maximum level of 4th. The maximum level affected increases to 8th when you cast this spell at level 9th, to 12th at level 13th, and to 16th at level 17th. For the purposes of this spell, a spellbook is considered to have a level equal to the minimum level necessary to cast the highest-level spell in it.
