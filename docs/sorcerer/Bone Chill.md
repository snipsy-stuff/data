### 📜 Description
This spell creates a cloud of cold necromantic energy that freezes the bones and blood of all living creatures touched by it. Living creatures within the dark cloud take 3d6 points of cold damage each round they are inside the cloud. Those within the cloud are also staggered. A successful Fortitude save negates the Staggered condition, but even with a successful save, being inside the cloud still causes 1d6 points of cold damage each round. Once cast, the spellcaster can shift the position of the bone chill cloud by 10 feet per round; however, the caster can take no other actions while moving the cloud.
