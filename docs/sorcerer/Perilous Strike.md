### 📜 Description
This spell guides the caster's claw (or other weapon) with supernatural knowledge. The next attack the caster makes during the duration that would miss its target gains a +20 bonus. If the caster strikes the target using this additional bonus, make a normal attack roll to confirm a critical as if you had threatened with a critical (whether you did or not). If you confirm the critical strike, resolve it as if you had really rolled a critical hit.  The spell affects only one attack and then ends.
