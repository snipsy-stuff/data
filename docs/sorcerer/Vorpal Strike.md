### 📜 Description
You may cast this spell upon any slashing melee weapon in range that has made a roll of natural 20 (but this spell is cast before the roll is made to confirm the critical hit). If the confirmation attack roll is missed, the spell is wasted, otherwise, the creature subject to the attack must make a Fortitude save or else the weapon severs the opponent's head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. Upon a successful save the creature suffers 5 points of damage per caster level if it has a head or is affected by the loss of its head.
