### 📜 Description
This spell creates a wave of magical energy that terrifies one or more creatures, inflicting the frightened condition. It affects the creatures with the lowest hit point totals first, selecting subjects one at a time until the next target would put it over the limit of 200. (Creatures with negative hit points count as having 0 hit points.) The duration of the spell depends on the total hit points of the affected creatures:

Hit Points    Duration Up to 50       Permanent 51 to 100     1d4+1 minutes 101 to 200   1d4+1 rounds
