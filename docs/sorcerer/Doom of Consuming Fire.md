### 📜 Description
This spell wreathes you in cold purple fire and damages each creature near you in melee. When casting this spell, you do subject yourself to severe chilling fire, and the freezing flames cause 1d8 hp cold damage to you each round.

Any creature within 5 ft. of you takes 1d12 hp cold damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15).

Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you from more than 5 ft. away.
