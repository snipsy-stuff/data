### 📜 Description
The target creature is filled with the power of a machine and becomes immune to almost all forms of death for a limited period. As part of the spell's casting, a construct or device is destroyed as a material component of the spell.

An intelligent animated creature or device used in this way must be willing (except for gearforged or those actively opposing the spellcaster, most animated creatures and devices are considered willing). While the spell is active, the target gains hardness 20/adamantine and a +6 circumstance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, the target gains immunity to death effects, critical hits, and death from massive damage. If the animated construct sacrificed had 10 or more HD, the spell grants temporary hp equal to one-quarter of those of the sacrificed construct.
