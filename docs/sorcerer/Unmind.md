### 📜 Description
Unmind disrupts all the recipient's higher mental functions, effectively removing its Intelligence score and reducing the creature to a state of sheer instinct, similar to vermin. The affected creature is unable to use any mental skill, cast spells, activate magic items, use spell-like abilities, use class features, understand language, or communicate coherently. 

Extraordinary or supernatural abilities are not affected, but the creature may not be able to effectively use or control them. The subject can use weapons it has in its hands or carries on its person at the time the spell takes effect (though it fails to recognize other weapons as such), but it takes a -4 non-proficiency penalty with such weapons whether it normally has proficiency or not. The subject's natural weapons (including unarmed strike) remain unaffected. 

While the spell is in effect, the subject remembers who its allies and enemies are, and can follow and even protect them. Likewise, it can attack enemies, though it's limited to simple tactics such as a mindless undead or vermin would use. The subject becomes immune to all mind-affecting and language dependent effects. 

Those targets fortunate enough to make their Will saves are still affected as if by a confusion spell for 1 round but are immune to subsequent castings of this spell from the same caster for 24 hours. 

The subject remains in this mindless state until a greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel the unmind effect.
