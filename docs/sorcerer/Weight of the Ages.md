### 📜 Description
This curse causes the targets to become old and decrepit. The targets age one age category per five caster levels (maximum three categories) and incur the physical penalties associated with old age (middle aged characters suffer a -1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity and Constitution, old an additional -2, and venerable an additional -3). For each category the targets age past venerable, they gain a negative level (same DC). If the target makes its initial saving throw, it ages only one age category. 

This curse only affects the physical bodies of the creatures, not their minds. Therefore it does not grant the bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma that age normally confers. It also does not affect creatures that gain benefits from aging such as true dragons. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
