### 📜 Description
You transmute your body and your equipment to become paper-thin and flexible. You can then fold yourself, as if you were parchment, into a tiny, fleshcolored, one-inch square. If you are moving, you immediately come to rest in the square in which you cast the spell. While in your folded state, you cannot cast spells or take any actions except dismissing the spell. You can be picked up, but the square weighs as much as you and your equipment weigh normally. However, you are fully aware of your surroundings, allowing you to see and hear to the normal limits of your abilities. If you are attacked in this state or are in the area of a damaging spell effect, fold immediately ends and you resolve the attack or spell as normal.
