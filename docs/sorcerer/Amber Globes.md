### üìú Description
You create up to five globes of electricity energy about the size of acorns, which can be hurled at targets by you or another creature, or can be detonated on command. Each globe is capable of dealing 2d6 points of electricity damage; you can hurl them singly or as multiple attacks. Each globe is a splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet, and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. Throwing a single globe is an attack action (that can be made as part of casting the spell), while throwing all the globes at single target is a standard action (or a full round action made as part of casting the spell). Globes not thrown during the round in which you cast the spell can be held for throwing in a subsequent round, or can be handed to other characters as a standard action. Each globe explodes upon striking any hard surface, and in addition to dealing its regular electricity damage to the target, deals 2 points of splash damage (also electricity damage) per globe in all adjacent squares. Creatures within the splash area that make a successful Reflex save take only half the splash damage, but creatures struck directly are not allowed a saving throw against the globe's primary damage.

Alternatively, you can gently toss or place a globe within 5 feet of you so that it does not explode on contact. Once in place, you can cause one or more globes to detonate by speaking a command word as a standard action if you are within 200 feet. When it detonates, the globe deals its electricity damage to all targets within a 5-foot burst. Creatures in the area that make a successful Reflex save take only half damage.
