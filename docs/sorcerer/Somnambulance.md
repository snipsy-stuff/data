### 📜 Description
Your ancestors' studies of eldritch slumber have taught you how to implant a suggestion into the mind of a creature under the effects of sleep or deep slumber. Magically sleeping creatures believe this suggestion comes from their own unconscious minds, and therefore do not get a save against the suggestion. However, as with that spell, suggesting a creature do an obviously harmful act negates its effects.

If the suggestion would take the creature longer to complete than the duration of the sleep or deep slumber spell, a new sleep-inducing spell must be cast on it before the initial spell's effect ends. Otherwise, the creature awakens and does not complete the activity. If this happens, it receives a Will save to realize the suggestion was the result of magic and not its own mind.

Typically, only tieflings can choose this spell, although other appropriate races may choose it at the GM's discretion.
