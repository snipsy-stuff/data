### 📜 Description
The subject's Charisma suffers a circumstance penalty that reduces it to 1. This may manifest as rudeness, boorishness or complete disinterest depending on the subject's attitudes before being affected by the spell. Creatures with a Charisma of 1 cannot cast spells as a sorcerer or bard does; if the creature is subject to damage or another penalty that would reduce its Charisma below 1, the spell ends.
