### 📜 Description
In the process of casting the spell, you plant a number of dragon's teeth in the soil. At the end of the spell's casting, these teeth change into clay golems who spring to the ground and serve you unquestionably. You can affect one dragon's tooth at 13th level and an additional tooth every 2 levels after that, to a maximum of four teeth at 19th level. They cannot speak but they understand any language you speak. They can follow only basic commands, such as attack, guard, or lift. If you are unable to command them, they follow your last command as best they can, if possible, though there is still a chance they can go berserk (note this spell is not dismissible and is not subject to being automatically dispelled). If left without a command, they stand inactive. They defend themselves if attacked. You can only have one active dragon's teeth warriors spell at a time, a second casting fails until the pervious warriors have been destroyed or the duration of the spell has expired.
