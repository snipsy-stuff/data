### 📜 Description
You conjure magical, ley-infused rocks that rain down from the sky and deal 4d6 hp bludgeoning damage and 3d6 hp electricity damage to every creature in the area. This damage occurs just once, when the spell is first cast.

For the remaining duration of the spell, clods of dirt and pebbles rain down in the area. Creatures inside this area take a -4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the raining dirt disappears, but the fallen rocks remain, affecting movement in the terrain.
