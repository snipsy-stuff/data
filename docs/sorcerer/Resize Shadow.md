### 📜 Description
You change the size of a natural shadow. You can distort it to as small as 1/10 its normal size or as large as 10 x its normal size. The shape of the shadow is always the same as it was before; only the size is altered. Resize shadow has no effect on shadow-based creatures or illusions.

The GM may grant up to +3 or -3 modifiers to Stealth checks based on smaller or larger shadows, depending on the situation.
