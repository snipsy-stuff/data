### 📜 Description
You create a fleshy shadow-copy of yourself. This creature is similar to a simulacrum, but it is less powerful and permanent than the creature created by that spell. The duplicate has only 1/5 of your class levels and/or HD (minimum 1 class level or HD). It also has only 1/5 your hp, and if you have any special abilities not tied to your class level (such as those resulting from feats), it can only use them once per day each.

You must make a Disguise check when you create the duplicate to determine how good the copy is; a creature familiar with you might detect a ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed to the caster's original Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check. Creatures receive bonuses to their Perception checks based on their familiarity with you (see the Disguise skill in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).

The duplicate creature cannot increase its abilities and skills. The duplicate remains under your control at all times, but no telepathic link exists, so commands must be verbal.

If the shadowself is reduced to 0 hp, it is destroyed.
