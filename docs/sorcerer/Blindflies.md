### 📜 Description
Blindflies can be cast on an object of up to Large size, and its effect is triggered when the object is touched. A huge cloud of millions of midges or gnats erupts from the object. This roiling cloud fills the eyes, nose and mouth of nearby creatures, requiring a Fortitude save or causing blindness for 1 minute per caster level. Creatures affected by this blindness receive a new save each round to recover from the blindness.
