### 📜 Description
This potent spell affects only living creatures, causing them to wither and crumble, eventually reducing them to dust. On the first round, all within the range (except you) suffer 1d6 points of damage. The next round, they suffer 2d6 points of damage. The next round deals 4d6, and so on, to a maximum of 16d6 points of damage each round. Creatures who make a successful save suffer half damage, but they must attempt a new saving throw each round. A saving throw is required of anyone who spends any amount of time in the range of the spell, so that even a character that entered the area and backed out again on the same action would still need to make a save. 

The damage progression always starts at 1d6 points of damage. So even if the spell has been going for 5 rounds, a target entering into range suffers 1d6 points of damage on his first round, 2d6, 4d6, 8d6 and finally 16d6. Exiting and reentering the spell's range, however, restarts the damage the victim was suffering as if he had not left - it does not start over. So, say a character stays in range for 3 rounds, and then leaves for 2 rounds. On his first round back in range, he suffers 8d6 points of damage. The spell's effect moves as you do, since it affects everyone in range of you.
