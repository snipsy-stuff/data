### 📜 Description
Dark powers grant you the ability to harness the wild energy and unleash it in a compact cloud on your enemies. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the rains deal 3d6 hp acid damage to each creature and object in their area of effect. In addition, the torrential rains obscure sight similar to the way a fog cloud spell does. It does not conceal darkvision.

This spell is most common among tieflings and is rarely seen elsewhere.
