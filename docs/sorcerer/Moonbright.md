### 📜 Description
This spell causes a globe of light about as bright as a full moon to explode silently from a point you select. All creatures except undead within the area of the globe are dazzled for 1d6 rounds and take 4d4 points of damage, while an undead creature caught within the globe takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4), or half damage on a successful Reflex save. In addition, any undead creature with an aversion to daylight is destroyed by the burst if it fails its save. Moonbright dispels any darkness spells of 6th level or lower within its area. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures, and lycanthropes caught within the globe are sickened rather than dazzled.
