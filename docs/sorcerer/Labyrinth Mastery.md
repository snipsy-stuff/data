### 📜 Description
Upon completing this spell, you immediately gain a sense of your surroundings. If you are in a maze, or any structure with multiple paths and numerous dead ends, this spell tells you the direction to the closest exit from the structure, although not necessarily the fastest way to reach that exit. This sense might change, as other exits might become closest while you move through the maze. In addition, while you are in such a structure, you gain a +4 insight bonus on any skill check to avoid being surprised and a +4 bonus on initiative checks.

Finally, this spell grants you a perfect memory of any area of the maze you have explored since casting the spell. If you revisit any such locations, you immediately notice any changes to the environment and realize that that you have explored this area before. While under the effects of this spell, you can exit a maze spell as a full-round action without needing to make an Intelligence check.
