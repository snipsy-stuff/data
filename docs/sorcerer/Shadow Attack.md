### 📜 Description
After casting shadow attack, a dark nimbus surrounds your hands, giving you the ability to damage others by attacking their shadows instead of their bodies. The targets' shadows only need to be hit with touch attacks, and all blows against a shadow inflict normal damage on the shadow's owner. Touch spells such as black hand can be transmitted through the target's shadow, but the target receives all normal saving throws and spell resistance benefits to any such magical attacks.

Shadow attack is especially deadly when used in conjunction with other spells, such as resize shadow and shadow shape, which allow the caster to make an opponent's shadow more accessible to him.
