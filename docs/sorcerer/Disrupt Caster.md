### 📜 Description
A ray of shimmering energy projects from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Creatures struck are surrounded by a field of disruptive energy and must make an opposed caster level check to successfully cast a spell. If the check is failed any spell the caster attempts is countered, each time they attempt to cast a spell they can attempt the check again.
