### 📜 Description
The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains DR 5/magic. It ignores the first 5 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though a magic weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), it is discharged.
