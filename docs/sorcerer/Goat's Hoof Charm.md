### 📜 Description
The target creature traverses craggy slopes with the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. When climbing slopes and inclines (but not vertical surfaces), the target can move without penalty at half their normal speed. The target also retains any Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing such surfaces and gains a +2 insight bonus on checks made to catch themselves after falling, or to Acrobatics checks to move along narrow surfaces.
