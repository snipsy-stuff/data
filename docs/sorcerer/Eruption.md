### üìú Description
Eruption creates a small volcanic eruption. On the round the spell is cast, the ground explodes at a point within range chosen by the caster. The explosion deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6) to all creatures within a thirty-foot radius. A Reflex saving throw reduces this damage by half. The explosion leaves a five-foot diameter eruption crater. This is a one-time effect. On the second round of the spell, noxious fumes and ash fill an area within a sixty-foot radius around the eruption. Any creature that breathes the air must make a Fortitude save or be sickened. The cloud lasts until the spell ends, at which point it dissipates into the atmosphere. 

Beginning on the third, round lava flows from the eruption crater. The lava fills a five by five foot square per round. If the spell is cast on a slope, the lava flows downhill, otherwise, it pools around the eruption site. Incidental exposure to lava deals 2d6 points of damage per round. Total emersion within the occupied square deals 20d6 points of damage per round. After exposure, the victim takes half the exposure damage (1d6 or 10d6) for an additional 1d3 rounds. The flow is slow enough that a character can estimate where the lava will flow the round prior to it entering her square and has no problem moving out of the way the round before. If she chooses to remain in the square, she receives no saving throw. The lava continues to flow until the end of the spell's duration at which point the lava flow begins to cool. 

This spell cannot be cast when there is no ground within range. The spell will function as long as the caster starts the spell in contact with the ground. The ground may be paved over, but an artificial floor by itself does not count as the ground.
