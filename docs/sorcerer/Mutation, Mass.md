### 📜 Description
This spell functions as mutation, but affects multiple creatures. Targets need not be of the same type or subtype, nor must they all acquire the same deformities (if using the temporary fleshcurdle-like effect) or mutations (if choosing to cause permanent mutation). However, if all targets are of the same type (and subtype, if applicable) and you choose to make all of the deformities or mutations inflicted by the spell the same for all targets, all targets take a -2 penalty to their saving throw.
