### 📜 Description
The target is constantly compelled to immediately travel to the location of its nearest blood relative and kill it. Once the target "chooses" a relative, the target continues to track and attack that relative until successful, then the target moves on the next nearest blood relative, until no more known blood relatives remain alive, or until someone removes the curse. If a blood relative is known but its location is not, the target is compelled to constantly investigate its location. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
