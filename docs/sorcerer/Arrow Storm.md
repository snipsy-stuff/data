### 📜 Description
You launch a fusillade of arrows, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 15d6, DR affects each die of damage not the total) to each creature within the area and inflicts the Pinned condition (CMB and Escape Artist DC equal to 11+ your caster level, creatures with DR that is not overcome by the piercing damage are immune to this effect). Creatures that make their saving throws take half damage and negate the Pinned condition; creatures with cover automatically negate the Pinned condition, take no damage on a successful save, and half damage if they fail their save.
