### 📜 Description
This spell creates a shimmering wall that completely blocks any magical effect. Anything encountering the wall behaves as if it had encountered an antimagic field, except that nonpermanent effects are automatically dispelled, not suppressed. As an antimagic field, wall of reaving is not subject to dispel magic.
