### 📜 Description
This spell transforms all metal in a contruct's body into bone. Though easily mistaken for a skeleton, it is not undead, and it retains all statistics and abilities with the exception of any natural armor bonus. Bone's relative lightness grants the construct several enhancement bonuses. While the spell is in effect, the construct's land speed is doubled and it gains a +10 bonus to Climb checks as well as to Acrobatics checks made for jumps or falls.
