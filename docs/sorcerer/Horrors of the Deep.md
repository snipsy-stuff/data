### 📜 Description
The horrors of the deep physically engulf your target, coating it in grim, slithering, twitching fluid and subjecting it to the despair of a drowning man. This inflicts 1d6 hp nonlethal damage each round on a failed save.

A successful Will save negates the damage for that round but does not end the effect. Instead, each successful save escalates the effect, ending it sooner but potentially causing more damage. If a target saves against this spell once, reduce the remaining duration by half and increase the nonlethal damage per round to 2d6 hp. If the target successfully saves a second time, reduce the duration again by half and increase the nonlethal damage per round to 4d6 hp. Three successful saves completely resists the spell.
