### üìú Description
This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, brilliant arc strikes one object or creature initially, and then arcs to other targets.

The bolt inflicts 1d4 hit points of electrical damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d4) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal 1 hit point of electrical damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5 points).

Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.
