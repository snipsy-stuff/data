### 📜 Description
You create a field of subsonic vibrations around you. The field is mobile and moves with you. Creatures within or entering this area after you cast this spell must make a Fortitude save or become nauseated while they remain within the area of effect. On a successful save, the target is instead sickened.

These conditions persist for 1d4 rounds after a creature exits the area of effect. This sound is too low for most humanoid creatures to hear. However, the sound does not have to be heard to affect those in the spell's radius, and it will work on deafened creatures. The vibrations also interfere with tremorsense, which is negated within the area of effect.
