### 📜 Description
This spell functions like lesser planar binding, except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.
