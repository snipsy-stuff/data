### 📜 Description
The target of this spell witnesses brief but cloudy visions of its own death. Disturbing thoughts and graphic images coupled with an intense feeling of dread dominate the subject's thoughts. The visions are so upsetting that the subject becomes cowered. The glimpses of the future are quick, vague, somewhat distorted, and cloaked in shadows, so they are of no help if the victim tries to use them to avoid the inevitable.
