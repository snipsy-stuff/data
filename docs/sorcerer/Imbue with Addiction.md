### 📜 Description
The target immediately becomes addicted to the drug used during the casting of the spell (see pages 236–237 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide for rules on drugs and addiction). If the target was ever addicted to the drug at any point in the past, it takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw.
