### 📜 Description
You inflict the curse of the ages upon the target. If this curse causes the target to advance an age category, she takes the penalties to her physical ability scores accompanying that age but does not gain the normal bonuses to her mental ability scores. In addition, the target is filled with a sense of hopelessness and failure as her life slips away. As long as the curse endures, the target gains no benefit from morale bonuses and takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against effects with the emotion descriptor, including fear effects. Whenever the target fails a saving throw against such an effect, she gains 1 Madness point (though she may gain only one Madness point per day in this fashion).
