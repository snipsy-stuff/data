### 📜 Description
Your tail gains a horrible stinger at the tip and lengthens to become whiplike. If you do not have a tail, you gain a wyvern's tail for the duration of the spell.

You gain a sting attack, which is a 10-ft. reach melee touch attack. A successful hit inflicts 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round for 8 rounds. The target makes a Fortitude saving throw each round to negate the damage and end the affliction. If you combine this natural attack with another attack or action, the normal secondary natural attack penalty applies.
