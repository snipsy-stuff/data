### 📜 Description
In a spectacularly awful series of very rapid bloody transformations, creatures targeted by this spell are literally (albeit briefly) turned inside out, suffering 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. In addition, all living creatures within line of sight to a creature slain by this spell must succeed on a Will save against the spell's DC or become frightened for 3d6 rounds. This secondary effect is a mind-affecting fear effect. 

Any creature that survives inside out reverts to normal immediately; the target's body successfully resists the magic (whether by saving throw or otherwise).
