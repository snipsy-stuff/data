### 📜 Description
You make the water churn and roil, increasing the DC of Swim checks and hampering the movement of creatures within. The DC to swim in the affected area is equal to the spell's DC and must be made each round the creature is in the area. Creatures who fail their Swim checks are pulled underwater 5 ft. and take 1d4 hp bludgeoning damage/2 levels from the churning water. Attacks made through or into the area of rough water suffer a 20% miss chance.
