### 📜 Description
This spell's illusory magic makes the target look like an exact physical duplicate of you. The duplicate retains all of its own abilities, but looks, smells, and sounds identical to you. The target gains none of your abilities. The possessions the target carries are similarly altered to appear the same as yours. If this spell is cast upon an unwilling target, the target receives a Fortitude save to negate this effect.

Upon looking at or interacting with a target of share skins, a successful Will save dissipates the illusion for that creature and the target appears simply a shadowy, sickly version of itself.
