### 📜 Description
You draw upon negative energy to transform your countenance into a horrible leering visage gaining a supernatural gaze attack. All within 30 feet who see this must make a Fortitude save (DC equal to the spell) or take 1 point each of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution damage per three caster levels (maximum 8 points). A creature who makes a successful saving throw negates the effect and is immune to this gaze attack for 24 hours.
