### üìú Description
You conjure a bow of magical force which can be wielded by you or attack on its own. As a move action, you can set the bow loose to attack once per round at a creature you designate (starting the round you release it). The bow shoots on your turn in the initiative order, staying in your space and firing at its target until the spell ends, the target leaves your line of sight, or you redirect the bow against another target (which requires a move action). If the bow has nothing to shoot at, it merely hangs in the air near you. With each shot, the bow generates a force projectile that functions just like an arrow fired from a regular shortbow (range increment 60 feet, damage 1d6), targeting only creatures and hitting with a ranged touch attack. If the bow attacks a creature that has spell resistance, check resistance the first time a projectile strikes it. If you fail to penetrate the spell resistance, this casting of the spell has no effect on that creature, but otherwise, successive attacks affect the creature for the full duration of the spell. The bow uses your base attack bonus (which might allow it multiple attacks if you take the full attack action) plus your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (whichever ability governs your spellcasting) instead of a Dexterity bonus. A projectile affects its target as a spell, not as a weapon, and so ignores damage reduction and immunity to piercing damage. As a force effect, the bow has no miss chance against incorporeal creatures, and it can affect ethereal creatures. If you choose to wield the bow yourself, you can fire normal or magic arrows (as available) from the bow, or you can use the bow to shoot force projectiles as a ranged touch attack (with all effects and damage as described above). If you use arrows you supply, you make normal ranged attacks, using your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (whichever ability governs your spellcasting) instead of your Dexterity bonus if you desire. When shooting force projectiles, you can fire the bow without penalty even if you don't have proficiency (though a -4 nonproficiency penalty applies when shooting arrows you supply). Any feats you have that improve your ability to wield a bow (including Weapon Focus, Point Blank Shot, or Rapid Shot) apply to any attacks you make. 

Firing a real arrow from the bow has no effect on the spell's duration, but each time the bow fires a force projectile (whether on its own or when wielded by you), the duration is reduced by 1 minute. If a shot would reduce the spell's duration to less than 0, the bow can no longer fire force projectiles. The bow cannot be attacked, but spells such as dispel magic or mage's disjunction have normal effect, while a disintegrate spell destroys it. Only you can fire the bow, and if you let it go without using a move action to set it loose to fire on its own, the spell ends.
