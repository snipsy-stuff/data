### 📜 Description
You conjure a sea of flames from the ground at a target location. The area is difficult terrain for the duration of the spell. Creatures take 1d6 hp fire damage and must succeed on a Reflex save or catch fire (see the Environment chapter in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook) each round they remain in the area.

The spell sets fire to combustibles and can melt metals with low melting points. Smoke in the area obscures vision, granting concealment (20% miss chance) to all creatures attacked in melee within it.
