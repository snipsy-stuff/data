### 📜 Description
You create a bolt of cold, dark energy which flies towards a single designated target. Successfully striking the target requires a ranged touch attack. The creature struck by the bolt takes 1d8 points of negative energy damage per 2 caster levels and must make a Fortitude save or be struck permanently blind. Undead creatures are immune to the damage, but not the blindness. Likewise, creatures without eyes are immune to the blindness.
