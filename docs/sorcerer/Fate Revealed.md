### 📜 Description
With a single touch, you cause the fates to smile on the target. That target gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. Unlike other spells that can be dismissed, this spell cannot be dismissed by the caster, but rather it can be dismissed by the target. As an immediate action, the target can reroll a single attack roll, skill check, or saving throw with a +4 insight bonus. Making this reroll dismisses the spell.

Fate revealed counters and dispels fate denied.
