### üìú Description
You ward a location with angelic power to prevent the entry of evil. During the casting, you inscribe an angelic seal on a solid surface-such as the ground, floor, wall, or ceiling-and infuse the area with holy energy. Outdoors, this creates a protective hemisphere in a radius centered on the seal. Indoors or underground, the seal conforms to the shape of the building, including floors, ceilings, walls, and doorways, up to the maximum area allowed. If the structure is too large to be covered by the spell's area, you may shape the area as you see fit.

Evil creatures cannot enter the warded area using extradimensional travel, as per the forbiddance spell. Any evil creature attempting to enter the area warded by the seal, or coming into physical contact with doors, windows, or walls under its effects, immediately takes 10d6 damage, is flung back 5 ft. for every 5 hp damage taken, is knocked prone, and is stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect. Evil creatures with the extraplanar subtype must also make a Will save or be forced back to their home plane. If the angelic seal is visible to such a creature, the DC of the save increases by 4.

The angelic seal is well-guarded against physical attacks, and it resists any damage done by weaponry, unless that weapon has the holy property or is good-aligned, whether manufactured or a natural weapon. A successful greater dispel magic, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can remove an angelic seal. Also, any lawful good outsider can remove the seal as a standard action by simply touching the seal and speaking a word.
