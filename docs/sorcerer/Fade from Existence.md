### üìú Description
You slip loose from the bounds of ordinary reality into the weird hyperspatial dimension of your cultic patrons. While in this extradimensional reality you can perceive the normal world around you and you can move through creatures or solid objects as if you were incorporeal, but creatures within normal reality cannot perceive you or affect you. In fact, when you fade from existence creatures within line of sight to you temporarily forget that you ever existed for 1 round (DC 20 Will negates). Creatures that have forgotten your existence cannot ready actions that depend on your actions.

You can target yourself or objects you carry with spells or effects while you fade from existence but you cannot affect other creatures or objects. Time passes normally when you fade from existence, and you reappear within reality at the end of your next turn. This brief transit through alien unreality causes you to become confused for 1 round (DC 20 Will negates) upon reverting to normal reality.

Optional Rule: You gain 1 Madness point rather than becoming confused at the conclusion of the spell (DC 20 Will negates).
