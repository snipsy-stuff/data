### 📜 Description
You enchant bleached bones or scrimshaw to communicate with other creatures. You may trace up to 10 words per round on the piece. All the other recipients of the spell can read the message on their matching pieces. The recipients can communicate with the caster and each other in the same fashion.

Destruction of a creature's piece ends the spell for that creature, while destroying the caster's piece ends the spell in its entirety.
