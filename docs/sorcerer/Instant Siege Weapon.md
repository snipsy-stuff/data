### 📜 Description
Through this spell, you transform raw materials into a siege engine or siege tower. You may set the raw materials in a particular location before casting this spell, or you may target other characters who have the raw materials in their possession. The individual raw materials must be no more than 50 ft. apart from each other or the spell fails. The siege weapon's maximum size is dependent on your level. Up to level 10, you can only create a Large siege weapon; from levels 10 through 14, you can create a Large or Huge siege weapon; and from level 15 onward, you can create any size siege weapon.

For siege engines that require ammunition, the spell creates enough ammunition for a number of uses equal to your level (maximum 15).
