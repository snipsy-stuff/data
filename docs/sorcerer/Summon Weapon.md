### 📜 Description
This spell summons one melee or ranged weapon (but not ammunition) of your choice. This weapon appears in your hands. The weapon is typical for its type and appropriate for your size. Only one weapon appears per casting, and only you can wield it. If you set it down or hand it to someone else, it vanishes as soon as you release it from your grasp. You can't summon a weapon too large to be held in your two hands.
