### üìú Description
You send one to five creatures or objects into the Ethereal Plane for a very short time. At the end of the duration, the subjects return to the exact location from which they left, unless that spot is no longer safe (it has been filled with stone, a fire has been set there, and so on); in that case, they appear in the nearest safe spot. 

During their time on the Ethereal, the creatures are in temporal stasis and cannot take any actions. 

Unattended objects gain no saving throw unless they are magical. The object must be smaller than a 10-foot cube to be affected. Creatures, however, can be of any size. Due to the "fivefold" nature of this spell, if the caster chooses to affect fewer than five targets, she can force one or more of them to make multiple saving throws. If any of the saves fail, the spell affects the subject. For example, if the caster affects three targets, one (caster's choice) must make three saving throws while the others each make one, as normal. If the spell targets two subjects, one must make three saves while the other must make two saves, or one must make four saves and the other just one. If this spell is cast upon one target, that creature or object must make five saving throws and succeed at all of them or suffer the spell's effect. A creature with spell resistance calls for a check against the spell resistance for each save required of it. 

This spell has no effect if cast on the Ethereal Plane.
