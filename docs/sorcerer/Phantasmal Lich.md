### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of a lich into the subject's mind. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal lich. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm lich touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or become permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis, or any spell that can remove a curse, can free the victim with a DC equal to this spell's DC. Otherwise, the effect cannot be dispelled.

Anyone paralyzed by phantasmal lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 4d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal lich attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the lich can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
