### 📜 Description
You create a piece of text that appears normal and harmless at first glance, but poses a serious danger to anyone reading it. In this case, "reading" the script means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. On a successful Will save, the reader of the tangled script is able to look away with only a slight sense of discomfort, but a failed save causes the reader to suffer a phantasmal assault that wreaks havoc on the mind, dealing 1d4 points of Intelligence damage and causing the victim to become fascinated for 2d4 rounds. The victim suffers the Intelligence damage each round it continues to read (this damage does not break the Fascinated condition). If the fascinate effect is broken early, the reader is left confused (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. 

Tangled script vanishes if even one creature reads it; but several different creatures can begin reading in the same round and all be affected. 

You can follow a secret page spell immediately by tangled script, so only creatures that discover the secret page are subject to the effects of this spell.
