### üìú Description
This spell grants you the ability to float on the air for a short time, allowing you to fall safely, to levitate, or even to fly depending on the force of the wind. In addition to gaining a +5 circumstance bonus to all Acrobatics checks while the spell is in effect, you gain the following abilities, depending on wind type and the load you carry.

‚Ä¢ Calm: You cannot fly or levitate, but you can fall or jump down a distance of 30 feet or less as a move action, provided you carry only a light load.

‚Ä¢ Light Wind: You can levitate if you carry no more than a light load, descending up to 40 feet or ascending up to 20 feet as a move action, or simply hovering in place. Alternatively, you can fall safely (as above) while carrying up to a medium load.

‚Ä¢ Moderate Wind: You can fly at a speed of 30 feet with good maneuverability so long as you carry no more than a light load. If you carry no more than a medium load, you can levitate (as above), or can fall safely if you carry a heavy load.

‚Ä¢ Severe or More Powerful Wind: As moderate wind. You are still susceptible to special wind effects (such as being blown away or knocked down), but wind affects you as though you are flying even if you aren't.
