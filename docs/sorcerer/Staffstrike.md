### 📜 Description
You send forth shockwaves from your staff, dealing 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 3d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures and objects within the area. Creatures are knocked prone and stunned for 1 round, and living creatures are also deafened for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates being knocked prone, stunned and being deafened, but does not reduce the damage.
