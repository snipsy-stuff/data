### 📜 Description
This spell makes targets' limbs feel remarkably heavy, making them drop all held items and slowing their movement by 20 ft. (40 ft. for flying movement). If this penalty reduces movement to zero, targets can no longer take move actions, use items, or cast spells with material components, though they can defend flat-footed.

At the end of the spell duration, affected creatures must make a Fortitude save or be exhausted. Creatures that successfully save are fatigued.
