### 📜 Description
This spell functions as ooze shape I and also allows you to assume the form of a Tiny or Large creature with the ooze type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the ability: acid, paralysis, transparent, engulf, corrosion, split, and suction.

If the creature has a climb or swim speed, you gain that movement at the creature's movement rate (max 30 ft.). You don't gain immunity to mind-affecting effects, but you do gain a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against such effects. You also gain blindsight and are not vulnerable to flanking or sneak attacks.

Split divides you into two similar jellies or oozes, each with half your hp. One contains your intelligence. The other is mindless, though it does not attack other creatures with the ooze type. When the spell ends, any other oozes created in this way disappear, and the remaining hp return to you. A caster who takes the form of a Tiny ooze gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity and a -2 penalty to Strength. A caster who takes the form of a Large ooze gains a +4 size bonus to Strength and a -2 penalty to Dexterity.
