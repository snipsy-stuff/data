### üìú Description
You summon 1d4 + 2 fiendish rot grubs inside the skin of each target creature, as if the target hand already failed its save against infestation. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation. They burrow toward the host's heart, brain, and other key internal organs, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round per rot grub. A successful save reduces the number of rot grubs to one. 

Burning the fiendish rot grubs has no effect but cutting the grubs does, but the longer the grubs remain in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting them out is very difficult requiring a slashing weapon and a successful Heal check (DC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier); whether or not this is successful, this procedure inflicts 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, one grub is removed. A remove disease spell causes the grubs to go dormant for one round. A heal spell will kill one grub per application, while a limited wish, regenerate, greater restoration, miracle or wish will kill all the grubs.
