### 📜 Description
Each target skeleton becomes a shrapnel-blasting weapon. (If any targeted skeleton happens to be unwilling, it may attempt a Will save to negate being affected by the spell.) When any target skeleton is destroyed (or at the end of the duration of army of shards), it detonates causing 1d10 piercing damage, +1 force damage/caster level (maximum of 1d10 + 10) to everything within 25 feet. Against this detonation, all targets may attempt a Reflex save for half damage.
