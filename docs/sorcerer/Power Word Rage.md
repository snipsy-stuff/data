### 📜 Description
You utter a single word of power that causes one target creature within range of the spell to fly into a blind, murderous rage, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total. Any creature that currently has 101 or more hit points is unaffected by power word rage. Any creature affected by power word rage immediately flies into a murderous frenzy, attacking the closest creature to him with little regard for his own safety. This rage approximates that of the rage spell, except the target of the spell does not distinguish friend from foe. He may not use any skills based on Charisma, Dexterity or Intelligence (even those normally useable by raging barbarians), nor may he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, spell trigger or spell completion to function.

Hit Points        Duration 
100 or less     1d4 hours 
101-150           1d4 minutes 
151-200           1d4 rounds
