### 📜 Description
A snakeball spell temporarily summons a spray of enraged poisonous snakes that bite any creature caught in their area of effect. Two snakes attack each victim that fails its Reflex save, and one snake attacks any victim that successfully saves. Effects such as evasion that negate damage on a successful save allow the character to avoid any snake attacks.

The vipers make bite attacks at +5 to hit with an additional +1 per 3 levels.  The victim must make a Fortitude save (DC 10+1 per 3 levels) or suffer from the poison of a tiny viper: bite-injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1 per 3 levels; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the snakeball is to burst. A green, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it hits a solid barrier or body before reaching the prescribed range, blossoms into the snakeball at that point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must "hit" the opening (their AC is usually 13) with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The snakes summoned disappear immediately after attacking.
