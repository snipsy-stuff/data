### 📜 Description
This evil spell summons a two-headed incorporeal vulture that the caster can send out to attack a target. On the physical plane, the vulture attacks with its two beak touch attacks. The attacks deal no damage, but drain 1d6 Wisdom on a hit. When the target is brought down to 0 Wisdom, the victim falls into a nightmare-filled sleep and the vulture has captured a portion of his essence. It then returns to its master and spits the essence out in the form of a worm.

If the caster swallows the worm, the victim's lost Wisdom is instantly restored, however the caster then has established a sensory link and complete control over the individual, as if the victim were subject to a dominate monster spell (no save). 

Outside of a wish or a miracle spell, the only way to reverse the control established by the spell is to remove the worm from the belly of the caster (where it otherwise remains) to be fed to the essence's owner. The vulture pursues the target for the duration of the spell. The vulture's stats are as follows:
