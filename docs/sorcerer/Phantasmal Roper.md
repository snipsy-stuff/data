### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of a roper into the subject's mind. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal roper. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the subject must succeed on Fortitude save or suffer 6d6 points of Strength drain as if the roper had hit with all its strands and the subject had failed its save against each strand. 

Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 7d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the creature can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
