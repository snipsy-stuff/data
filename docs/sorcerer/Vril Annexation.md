### 📜 Description
This spell allows you to convert a selected touch-range spell into compatible vril energy, effectively delivering its effects at a range through a ray of vril rather than dealing the vril blast's normal damage or healing.

When you cast this spell, select any touch-range spell of 4th level or lower that you can cast. This prepared spell or spell slot of the appropriate level is converted into vril energy and stored for 1 round, during which time you can unleash a vril blast as a standard action. You must make a ranged touch attack roll for this ray with a +2 bonus. This ray delivers the effects of the sacrificed-touch range spell to the target. If the converted energy of the spell is not used in 1 round, the spell energy is wasted.

Addition from Vril Annexation:Does normal amount of healing or damage.
