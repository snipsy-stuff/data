### 📜 Description
Ash, cinders and smoke rise into a great cloud that obscures vision and heats the air within it. Once created, the cloud is stationary. This spell functions like obscuring mist except that fire spells do not burn off the mist. Water- and cold-based spells such as cone of cold or sleet storm will clear out the smoke and ash, however. Anyone within the cloud takes 2d6 fire damage each round. Affected creatures may attempt a Reflex save for half damage. Spell resistance applies normally to the fire damage. This spell does not function underwater.
