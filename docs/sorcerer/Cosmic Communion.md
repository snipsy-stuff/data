### 📜 Description
This spell casts your mind out across the cosmos, into contact with alien intelligences from far beyond. Except as noted above, this spell functions like contact other plane, but if you fail the Intelligence check to avoid decreasing your Intelligence and Charisma to 8, you also take Wisdom damage equal to the difference between your Intelligence check and the target DC.

In addition, failing this check attracts the attention and interest of the cosmic entity you contacted, with a chance equal to 5% times the difference between your Intelligence check and the target DC that the entity sends one or more alien minions to investigate within 1d10 days. Treat this as a summon monster spell using the Summon Star-Spawn feat, summoning one or more mythos creatures or creatures with the alien template. This functions as summon monster III if using the Elemental Plane line, increasing the level of the summon monster effect by one step for each step by which the caster tries to increase the power of his divination. These summoned creatures focus their attention on the caster of cosmic communion but will happily destroy any other creatures that get in their way or happen to be nearby when they appear. If they appear during a battle, they are equally likely to target the caster’s enemies as his allies.

Optional Rule: If using the alternate Madness and Sanity rules from Chapter 6, you gain an equivalent number of Madness points instead of Wisdom damage.
