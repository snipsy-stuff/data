### 📜 Description
You employ primal darkness to render your target unable to see in conditions of darkness, but you leave it otherwise unharmed. Whether the target has darkvision or can see in darkness as a racial trait or as a spell or item effect, darkblindness removes the ability and prevents subsequent spells or effects from granting the ability. This spell does not actually dispel spells that grant darkvision, so undoing the effects of darkblindness restores any such spells, item effects, etc. Remove blindness/deafness restores the target's ability to see in darkness, but heal or stronger magic is required otherwise.
