### üìú Description
You transfer some of your prepared spells (or spell slots) into an ioun stone, which you touch at the culmination of this spell. If you spontaneously cast spells, you must designate which spells you are storing in the ioun stone at the time of casting.

When the stone is orbiting a character's head, the character can cast spells from the ioun stone if he has at least an Intelligence or Charisma score of 10. The transferred spells' variable characteristics (DC, range, damage, duration and so on) function according to your level at the time you cast this spell. The activation is the same as the spell's normal casting time. Casting a spell this way provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

Only arcane spells can be transferred by spell stone. The number and level of spells the subject stone can hold depends on its value.{

Table 2-14: Spell Stones

Stone Value            Spells Stored
Up to 8,000 gp        1st-level spell
Up to 20,000 gp     One or two 1st-level spells
Over 20,000 gp      One or two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell

Once you cast spell stone, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell or use one 4th-level spell slot until the recipient uses the imbued spells, or until you dismiss the spell. If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active spell stone spells, the more recently cast spell stone is dispelled.

This spell cannot transfer spells into an ioun stone created with the iounmancer's summon stone or star mantle abilities
