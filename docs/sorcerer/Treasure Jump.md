### 📜 Description
The object enchanted with this spell can make a short teleporting hop of 10 ft. per level. You can initiate the hop by mental command (you must have line of sight to the object), or you may specific a predetermined location within range when the spell is first cast.

This spell is often used to lure foolish treasure hunters into dangerous areas, or to frustrate them by stealing valuables from their very hands. Kobolds also use pressure-plates that spring traps when the object is moved, or they cast this spell on support pillars within their lairs.
