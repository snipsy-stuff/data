### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image in the minds of all targets of a false reality that blocks out all other stimuli simply by forming the thoughts of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can already and believably visualize: this phantasmal world. Only the spell's subjects can see the phantasmal world. You see only vague shapes. Each target first gets a Will save to recognize the images as unreal. If that save fails, the false existence masks the true world. The subjects must succeed on a second Will save or be afflicted with the helpless condition in the true world (they could eventually die from aging or starvation) though they continue to act in the false reality. If a subject of phantasmal world succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the spell can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its mind- affecting attack.
