### 📜 Description
You grant the ability to see traces of magic. The subject may follow the trail of any creature that has abilities. The subject must still make Survival checks and have the Track feat to attempt to trail someone in this fashion. Instead of weather affecting the subject's ability to follow, discharges of magic in an area have the same effect as rain on the magical tracks. The spell lets the subject see a faint, glowing trail, but the subject cannot tell what type of magic creates it. For every three active items/spells/abilities, the subject gains a +1 circumstance bonus to the Track check. This spell does not help the subject track via magic used to conceal or alter normal tracks, such as trackless step or dust of tracelessness, but it would still give the subject a chance to track other active magic in the possession of someone using those magics to avoid being tracked.
