### 📜 Description
You conjure a mad cacophony of blindingly bright, scintillating lights that flicker around the creature touched. The lights are so fierce that creatures looking at the subject are blinded for 1 minute (The spell's target is immune to this effect). Creatures that successfully save cannot again be affected by the same scintillating lights)

Scintillating lights also grants the target concealment (20% miss chance) and illuminates the surrounding area as a light spell.

Sightless creatures are immune to scintillating lights.
