### 📜 Description
You create high-vibrato sound in the area around you. This effect negates any sound-based blindsense or blindsight of creatures within the area (such as bats or a caster using the echolocation spell). Any creatures within the area of effect find the sound loud, painful, and distracting, and they take a -1 penalty to attacks, ability checks, and skill checks.

Spellcasters must make concentration checks to successfully cast while within the field (DC equal to 10 + the spell's level). Deafened creatures are immune to penalties and do not need to make concentration checks. Those within the field must shout to be heard, and any hearing-based Perception checks are made with a -20 penalty.
