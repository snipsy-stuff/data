### 📜 Description
You fire a bolt of eldritch energy that passes through walls, doors, and other solid barriers and ends in an explosion. The explosion also bypasses non-living barriers, negating cover. Even creatures under the effects of meld into stone are hurt by this spell. Unlike most spells, you do not need a clear line of effect for phasing blast. You need only choose a direction and a distance at which you want the explosion to occur. The blast deals 1d6 points of energy damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), to all living creatures within the area of effect. This spell does not affect nonliving creatures such as constructs or undead.
