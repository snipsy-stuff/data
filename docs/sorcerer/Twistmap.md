### 📜 Description
This spell renders a map subtly but seriously inaccurate by changing the direction of critical turns, suggesting blind or unexplored areas are in fact already travelled, etc

When making a Survival or Perception check using the map, the GM should secretly add a -10 to the roll. A failed result should be described to the party as a success, but the GM should then lead them into a trap or dead end. The party may make a DC 20 + the caster's level survival check to figure out that the map has been magically altered if they specifically ask about its accuracy.
