### 📜 Description
The opponent you touch gains a 50 percent hit chance: 50 percent of the attacks targeting the creature that normally would miss it now hit. This curse negates the effect of any other miss chances, whether it comes from incorporeality, concealment, or a similar source. In such a condition, however, the effects of the curse are also negated.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
