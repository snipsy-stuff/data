### 📜 Description
You cast your arms downward and a dimensional sinkhole funnels you and the target into another dimension. To all observers, you both simply vanish. Both of you can still see, but neither of you can hear or smell. The world and everything in it looks like a confusing, ghostly overlay atop a featureless dimension that stretches to infinity in every direction. Normal gravity holds you to a flat floor

While in the alternate dimension, you and the target can see each other normally, and you may converse, duel, trade, etc. Neither of you can affect or be affected by anything outside the alternate dimension, including magic and ghost touch weapons.

The spell ends when you dismiss it or when the target makes a successful save, which it may attempt each round on its turn. When the spell ends, you both appear in your original positions you left from. If solid objects occupy the positions, you are shunted (unharmed) to the nearest open space.
