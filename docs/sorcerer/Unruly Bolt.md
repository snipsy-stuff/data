### 📜 Description
A bolt of the chaotic energies of creation springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The ray deals 1d2 points of damage of a random type with no splash damage. For every three caster levels you possess, the energy, unless neutralized, lasts for another round (to a maximum of 4 additional rounds at 10th level), dealing another 1d2 points of damage in each round. Each round, roll on the chart to determine the damage type.
