### 📜 Description
Time capsule can be used on any closeable object, such as a bottle, chest, or enclosure (a small room or cave). When the object is closed, time ceases to flow for every item, creature, or character within the object. They do not grow older. Body functions of any living creatures or characters virtually cease.

However, if the object is opened, time moves freely until the object is closed again (if the spell is still active). If the object is broken open, the spell's duration ends, even if it is made permanent via the permanency spell.

Time capsule can be made permanent with a permanency spell at a cost of 15,000 gp and minimum CL 14th.
