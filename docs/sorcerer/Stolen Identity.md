### 📜 Description
By touching the face of another person while casting this spell, you acquire his or her voice and facial features. Other aspects of body and equipment are not duplicated, but the spell gives a +5 enhancement bonus to the Disguise check to impersonate the individual (+10 if only the face and voice are needed.) A dead or unconscious owner of the stolen face dead still gets a saving throw. While the spell is in effect, the target may only speak in a hoarse whisper.
