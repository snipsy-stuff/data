### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, the touched object becomes hidden in plain sight. The DC to perceive the object is equal to the caster's Stealth check or the Stealth check of an ally that the caster is aiding (successful use of aid another, a failure of this check ends the spell). In any case, a +2 circumstance bonus is added to the Stealth check. The object will go unnoticed by anyone failing a Perception check against the Stealth DC set by.
