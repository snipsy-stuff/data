### 📜 Description
This spell functions similarly to plane shift, but instead of transporting the targets to a destination near an intended location on a specific plane, anywhere but here transports affected creatures to a random plane. A creature can be affected by anywhere but here only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell). Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM’s whim.

d% Planar Destination
1–7 Abyss
8–14 Abaddon
15–20 Hell
21–24 Shadow Plane
25–28 First World
29–35 Maelstrom
36–42 Boneyard
43–49 Axis
50–56 Ethereal Plane
57–63 Elysium
64–70 Nirvana
71–77 Heaven
78–84 Astral Plane
85–90 Random demiplane
91–95 Material Plane (random world)
96–100 GM’s choice

A creature that is transported by anywhere but here cannot be affected by a subsequent casting of anywhere but here for 24 hours afterward (but can be affected normally by other forms of planar travel).
