### 📜 Description
This spell renders an object of 15 lbs. or less insubstantial to all creatures but you. You must be able to see the object in order to cast this spell on it. If used offensively (for example, to affect a potion on someone's belt, a sword in their hand, or their pants), the bearer of the object can negate the spell's effect with a successful Will save.  If an object carried or worn by a creature becomes insubstantial, it falls off the bearer's body or out of its hand.

If mine! is cast on a major artifact, the spell automatically fails, and you must make a Will save or be confused for 1 minute/level.

Objects affected by mine! are insubstantial to any creature but the caster who tries to to grasp, hold, move or attack the object. The objects are not insubstantial in other respects: for example, they do not sink through floors or tables, or pass through walls. A fragile item worn on a belt will still shatter if it hits the ground.
