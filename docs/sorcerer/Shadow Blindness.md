### 📜 Description
You negate one creature's darkvision, as long as it is granted as a racial trait and not a spell or an item effect. This spell is not effective against magical darkvision.

If you negate its darkvision, the victim is considered to have normal human sight and cannot see in complete darkness for the duration of the spell as long as it does not use a spell or item to regain darkvision. When this spell ends, the creature's natural darkvision returns.
