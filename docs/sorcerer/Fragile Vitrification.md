### 📜 Description
The target of this spell turns into glass, as if it were a mindless, inert statue. (The target's possessions do not transform.) The glass statue shatters 1 round after it forms. Before it shatters, should the glass get broken or damaged, the target has similar damage or deformities if ever returned to its original state. 

The target is not dead (its soul doesn't pass on), but when viewed with spells that detect life, it does not seem to be alive either. A heal spell cast before the statue shatters will restore the creature. A regenerate spell, cast on the shattered glass, will restore the shattered target. A creature restored by regenerate may be slightly altered if any of the shattered fragments were missing (GM discretion). If such missing fragments can be found, another regenerate spell will properly restore those bits to the whole creature.
