### 📜 Description
Your words cause your target's face to twist and contort as he turns to vent his wrath on his ally. You force a target to attack its nearest ally. This attack can be of any sort, but it must be an attack that, to the creature's knowledge, deals damage and is the most effective form of attack in the target's arsenal. If the creature has no ally, or if all its allies are out of attack range, it takes no actions but defends itself normally.
