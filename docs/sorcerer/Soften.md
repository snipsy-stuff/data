### 📜 Description
You cause all the objects in the area to become softer, making them more susceptible to damage. Unattended nonmagical objects and materials receive no save. Magic items make saving throws as usual, and creatures may make saving throws for their items. Failure indicates that the item or material has its hardness reduced by 5 for the duration of the spell. This only makes damaging the objects easier; it does not reduce a creature's armor or natural armor bonus to AC. Creatures with hardness, such as animated objects, must also make a successful saving throw or have their hardness reduced.
