### 📜 Description
You create a number of immobile and invisible shields that float above the floor, each occupying a 5-foot space. You may place these shields anywhere within range, and they need not be in adjacent spaces. Any creature who occupies a space also containing a shield gains a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies to incorporeal touch attacks, as it is a force effect. Creatures cannot not use these shields for cover.
