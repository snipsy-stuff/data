### üìú Description
You conjure a fist with a diameter of 8 to 9 feet made of roaring fire, freezing ice, corrosive acid, seething  electricity or clashing thunder. The fist flies through the air at a speed of 90, as you direct (a free action in a given round). You can use the fist to attack a single target, with its attack bonus equaling your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier. Directing the fist to attack in any given round, as opposed to just having it move, is a move action. The fist inflicts 1d6 points of the chosen energy type damage per two caster levels (maximum 12d6) plus a special effect based on the energy chosen:

Acid: Creatures struck, regardless of size, must make a Reflex save or their equipment suffers half its hp total in damage and suffers from the broken condition.

Cold: Creatures struck that are smaller than Large must make a Reflex saving throw or be absorbed into the fist. Those absorbed move with the fist and suffer from the paralyzed condition and are subject to suffocation. The fist can hold two Medium, four Small, eight Tiny, or sixteen Fine creatures.

Electricity: Creatures struck, regardless of size, must make a Fortitude save or suffer the dazed condition for 1 round. Fire: Flammable objects (including creatures) within 5 feet of the fist catch fire and suffer 1d6 points of fire damage per round (no save) until someone uses a full-round action to put out the flames.

Sonic: Creatures struck that are smaller than Gargantuan must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.

The spell takes on the descriptor of the energy chosen. If you so wish it, the fist can attempt bull rush, charge, overrun, or sunder actions (CMB equals your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier +4). It does not make attacks of opportunity.
