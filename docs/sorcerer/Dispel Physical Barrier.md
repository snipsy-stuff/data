### 📜 Description
This spell does 100hp damage/level to non-living physical barriers. Animate objects, such as constructs, are not affected. This spell negates a wall of force as if it had been subject to a disintegrate spell. If a particular object has enough hit points to not be destroyed by a casting of dispel physical barrier then the effect radiates away from the point where the caster touches the object, destroying the matter of the physical barrier until all the damage has been inflicted (exact results subject to GM adjudication).
