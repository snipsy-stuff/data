### 📜 Description
This spell is cast in conjunction with the burial of a chest of treasure. Once this spell is cast, up to 100 Hit Dice of living creatures within the spell’s range immediately lose any recollection the burial site, as well as the contents of the treasure chest. You may choose to lose your memory of the site as well, but within a day of casting the spell, a tattooed map appears somewhere on your flesh. At your option, you may grant a single creature, which can be you, the ability to decode the map, thereby gaining full understanding of the location and the chest’s contents, even if the target was not present at the time of the original casting.
