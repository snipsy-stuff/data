### 📜 Description
You target one creature and choose one elemental damage type: fire, electricity, acid, and cold. The creature is immune to that energy type for the duration of the spell. While this spell is in effect, the target creature's body and equipment are coated in a translucent, insubstantial essence.

Typically, only dragonkin can choose this spell, although other appropriate races may choose it at the GM's discretion.
