### 📜 Description
As freeze, but also coats targets in an icy rime. Affected creatures take 2d6 hp cold damage +1 per level (maximum +10).

If an initial Fortitude save is successful, the damage is halved and the freezing-in-place effect is negated, as with freeze. Also as with freeze, targets are entitled to saves every round as a full-round action to end the freezing-in-place effect.
