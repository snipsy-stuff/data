### 📜 Description
You unleash a burst of superheated steam centered on you. Creatures within the burst take 1d8 hp fire damage per level (maximum 15d8). Non-magical, unprotected fires smaller than a bonfire within the area are extinguished. Everything within the area becomes soaking wet, and normal fires cannot be lit within the area for 1 hour after the burst. You are unaffected by your own blast. Steam blast works exactly the same way underwater. Steam blast counters and dispels a wall of ice.
