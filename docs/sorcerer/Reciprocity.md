### 📜 Description
When cast, this spell creates an arc of pure magical energy between you and the target. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per level (maximum 10d8) to the target, but it also deals half that amount of damage to you. The damage dealt to you cannot be negated or reduced by any means, but the damage to the target can negated by any means that would normally do so such as the incorporeal miss chance or spell resistance.
