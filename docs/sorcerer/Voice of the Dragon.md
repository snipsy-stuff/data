### 📜 Description
You change your voice to that of a powerful adult dragon. While under the effects of voice of the dragon, you may speak in a booming voice that can be heard clearly up to one mile away. You may also create any vocalizations that an adult dragon would be able to create, such as a hiss or roar. You gain a +10 bonus on Disguise and Bluff checks to conceal your identity from creatures that cannot see you.

In addition, once during the duration of the spell, you may emit a terrifying draconic roar that causes all opponents within 60 ft. to become frightened for 1d6 rounds; kobolds who fail their saving throws cower for 1d6 rounds instead. Creatures that succeed on their saving throws become shaken for 1 round. Kobold allies in the area of effect gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against fear for 1 minute. Using this effect does not end the spell.
