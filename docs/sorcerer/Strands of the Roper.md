### 📜 Description
You gain a strands ranged touch attack like that of a roper equal to 1 for every 4 caster levels you possess. You can extend up to six of the thin, sticky strands from your body at a time, launching them to a maximum range of 50 feet. These strands are quite strong, but can be severed by any amount of slashing damage (a strand is AC 20). A creature struck by a strand is numbed and weakened by the strange material, and must make a Fortitude save (DC equal to 10 plus 1/2 your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier) or take 1d6 points of Strength damage.
