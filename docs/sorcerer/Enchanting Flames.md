### 📜 Description
You cause a fire source to generate an aura that causes creatures within the area of effect to become fascinated unless they succeed on a Will save. Any attack against the fascinated target automatically breaks the effect. An ally of the fascinated creature may shake it free of the spell as a standard action. In addition to the fascination effect, once per round as a standard action, you can make a suggestion (as the spell) to one fascinated creature, which gets a new saving throw against the suggestion (but not the fascination). A creature must be able to see the fire source to be affected by this spell, and anything that blocks a fascinated creature's line of sight breaks the effect. If the fire source you chose as the center of the emanation is mobile, fascinated creatures try to follow it to the best of their ability as it moves (but note that the fascinate effect is lost if such movement breaks line of sight). When the source moves, a fascinated creature moves at one-half speed toward it, even if the source's movement leaves the creature temporarily outside the area of effect. The creature takes the most direct route available, but if that route leads into a dangerous area (through fire, off a cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second saving throw. If the creature cannot re-enter the emanation at the end of its movement, the fascination effect is broken. A creature that makes a successful save or has had line of sight to the fire source broken cannot be affected again by this particular casting of the spell.
