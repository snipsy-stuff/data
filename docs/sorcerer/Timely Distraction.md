### üìú Description
You call forth swirling, jerking, crackling wave of constantly shifting display pops, flashes, and swept-up debris. You can use this chaos to make a dirty trick combat maneuver against any one creature anytime during this spell's duration. Once you've attempted the dirty trick (successfully or not), the timely distraction ends

The exact effect of the dirty trick is determined at random by rolling 1d6 (see table below). Your CMB for this dirty trick is equal to your level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This dirty trick does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If your CMB check fails, this spell fizzles.
