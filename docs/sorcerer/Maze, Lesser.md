### 📜 Description
This spell functions as maze, but the target gets a Will save to resist being sent to the extradimensional prison. In addition, the maze is not nearly as difficult, requiring only a DC 15 Intelligence check to navigate. Finally, if the target does not escape within a number of rounds equal to your level, it returns to its previous location.
