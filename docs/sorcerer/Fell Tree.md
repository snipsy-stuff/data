### 📜 Description
You summon a single tree with a height no greater than 10 ft. per caster level (max 150 ft.) to appear uprooted and falling in a designated direction. Creatures and objects in the path of the falling tree suffer 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per ten foot increment of the tree's height (max 15d6). If a creature has DR 5 (or better) takes no damage if the bludgeoning damage from the tree is 5 or fewer points. The tree affects a line equal to its height with a width equal to one-quarter its height. Therefore, a 100 ft. tree affects an area 100 ft. long and 25 ft. wide and deals 10d6 points of damage to creatures and objects that fail a Reflex saving throw. Naturally, the surrounding terrain and intervening natural obstacles, such as other trees and dense underbrush, lessen the tree's impact so that it only deals 1d4 points of damager per 10 foot increment of the tree's height (max 15d4). 

Creatures that fail their saving throw not only take damage, but may also find themselves pinned beneath the tree. If the character rolls a natural 1 on his Reflex saving throw, the character is pinned beneath the tree. He remains pinned until help arrives or he extricates himself by making a Strength check (DC 25) or an Escape Artist check (DC 30). While pinned, he takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute until he falls unconscious. Once unconscious, he must make a Constitution check (DC 15) every minute. If he fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute until the character is freed, dies, or the summoned tree disappears after 24 hours.
