### 📜 Description
Shadow plane adaptation gives the caster immunity to the harmful environmental effects of the Shadow Plane, including cold, darkness, and the confusion the plane causes to those unfamiliar with it.

Additionally, the caster gains immunity to negative energy effects. The spell does not remove negative levels that the subject has already gained or their effects.

If shadow plane adaptation is cast when on a plane other than the Shadow Plane, it grants resist energy 3 (negative), but no other benefits.
