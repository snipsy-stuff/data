### 📜 Description
You sacrifice your blood to implore the dragon god of the sea to strike at your enemies. All enemies within the spell's radius are affected.

You must deal 1 hp damage to yourself for each 1d6 hp damage/round you wish to inflict on affected enemies, to a maximum of 5 hp damage to yourself and 5d6 damage to your target. Jets of water batter creatures and objects in the area, inflicting the indicated damage. Creatures that succeed on a Reflex save take half damage.

Water in the area remains turbulent for the duration of the spell. Swimmers in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Swim check each round to avoid sinking. Boats that rely on sails or rowing for propulsion cannot leave the area using those means.
