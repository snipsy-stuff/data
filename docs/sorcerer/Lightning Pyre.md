### 📜 Description
A bolt of lightning shoots out from overhead, creating a burning pyre, half lightning and half fire, that causes 1d6/level (maximum 15d6) electrical and fire damage to anyone caught in it (Reflex save halves). As half the damage is fire-based and the other half electrical, defenses such as fire shield (chill) or endure elements (electricity) are only effective against half the damage done. 

The pyre continues to burn for the duration of the spell, and so long as the pyre burns, and the spellcaster stands within 30 ft. of it, he can perform the following acts, as a move action one per round: cast a shocking grasp or burning hands spell (either on himself or through a familiar), cast a lightning bolt or fireball, or surround one weapon in lightning as per the shock weapon special ability or fire as per the flaming ability (these effects last for as long as the pyre).
