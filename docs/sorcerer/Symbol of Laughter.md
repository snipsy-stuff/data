This spell functions as symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet are affected with uncontrollable laughter (as hideous laughter) for 1 round per caster level.

Unlike symbol of death, symbol of laughter has no hit point limit; once it is triggered, a symbol of laughter remains active for 1 minute per caster level.

Symbol of laughter can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 10th level or higher at a cost of 5,000 gp.
