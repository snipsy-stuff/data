### 📜 Description
The blood of the targeted creatures begins to boil. If a target fails its save, it takes 1 point of fire damage per round. This spell has no effect on creatures that don't have blood. If a target has the orc subtype, it doesn't take fire damage and instead gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength.
