### üìú Description
The mechanical device you touch ceases to function for the duration of the spell, so that a cart no longer rolls, a door no longer opens or closes, a trap does not trigger, and so on. Any object with moving parts can be affected by this spell. In the case of a mechanical barrier (such as a door), the barrier can still be destroyed as normal if this spell holds it closed. Vehicles can be moved with appropriate force, but wheels, rudders, and other moving parts remain frozen, impeding directional control and normal movement. For example, a cart under the effect of this spell requires as much effort to push forward as it normally would to push it sideways.
