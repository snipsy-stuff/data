### 📜 Description
This spell forces a target to remain in contact with the ground so that it cannot fly, wind walk, levitate, or use gaseous form or other effects that allow for floating and flying-like effects. This spell cannot be used against a target already flying, levitating or floating-the target must be in contact with the ground when it is cast for it to be effective.
