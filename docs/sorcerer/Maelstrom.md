### üìú Description
This spell allows you to create a whirlpool anywhere with devastating effects. 

You create a 10- foot- radius per- caster- level sphere or hemisphere of water; in its center there is a 5-foot wide extradimensional hole that produces a powerful vortex. Within that extradimensional space, the vortex is 10- feet- percaster- level deep; the whirlpool does not otherwise displace any original underlying material (such as the floor). All creatures in the area of effect can hold their breath as a free action at the moment this is spell is cast. You can create the vortex on the deck of a ship as easily as on a dungeon floor or in the open sky. The vortex produces a powerful current extending from the edge of the vortex to a distance equal to the vortex's depth, such that a creature in the area of effect must make a Swim check (DC equal to your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier) to swim normally. Failure means the creature cannot use a move action to move this round and is drawn 1d6 x 10 feet toward the center of the vortex. If the Swim check fails by 5 or more, the swimmer is sucked down beneath the vortex. Freedom of movement has no affect against a maelstrom spell as this is normal movement, and movement caused by a maelstrom does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When a creature reaches the vortex, it must make another Swim check at the same DC. If this check succeeds, the swimmer is ejected from the vortex and thrown to the edge of the effect (roll randomly to determine direction). If the check fails, the swimmer is pulled down. 

A creature pulled down takes 1d6 points of magical bludgeoning damage per caster level (creatures with damage reduction 5 or higher than cannot be overcome by magical bludgeoning damage are immune to this damage) and remains pinned on the bottom, where it takes an additional 1d6 points of damage each round. The creature can only escape by making a successful Swim check (same DC needed to avoid being pulled under). If successful, the swimmer is thrown clear of the vortex but remains underwater at the vortex's depth (roll to determine direction). When the duration of the spell ends, creatures and objects within the hole instantly rise up from the bottom of the vortex until they are at the original top of the vortex. 

Boats and ships can fall afoul of the vortex just as creatures can, but the vessel's pilot can fight the current with a Profession (sailor) check (same DC as a Swim check to resist the current). On a failed check, a boat or ship less than 20 feet long has a 95% chance to capsize, a vessel from 20 to 60 feet long has a 50% chance to capsize, and a vessel over 60 feet long has a 20% chance to capsize. Even if a vessel doesn't capsize, it is drawn 1d6 x 10 feet toward the vortex on a failed check. When a vessel reaches the vortex, it suffers 4d6 points of damage and may sink unless its pilot makes a successful Profession (sailor) check (same DC as a Swim check to resist being pulled under, but with a +1 bonus per 10 feet of the vessel's length). If the vessel sinks, it breaks apart and goes under in 1 round, with all creatures aboard thrown into the water and forced to make Swim checks to avoid being sucked under.
