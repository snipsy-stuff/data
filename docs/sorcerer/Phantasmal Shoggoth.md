### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of a shoggoth into the subject's mind. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal shoggoth. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or become confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round a creature is affected it takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The subject also believes it is attached each round suffering 3d6 + 15 bludgeoning damage, then the shoggoth constricts (3d6 + 15), and then engulfs (4d6 + 22 bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 acid damage). Once engulfed the subject suffers only that damage each round. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 7d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the creature can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
