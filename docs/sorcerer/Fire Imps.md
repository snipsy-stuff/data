### 📜 Description
You create a swarm of Diminutive fire elementals that act immediately on your turn, attacking your opponents to the best of its ability. The swarm has a 10-foot space but can occupy any four contiguous squares. Initially, it must appear on a surface and in a space that can hold it, and at least one of the squares the swarm occupies must contain or touch a fire source at least as large as a standard torch. If you can communicate with the swarm (the fire imps speak Ignan), you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The swarm of fiery imps sets alight any flammable material it touches, and can set creatures alight. The fire imps from this spell always function as a group, and any fire imp separated from the swarm ceases to exist. In all other aspects it acts as a wasp swarm (See the Pathfinder Bestiary). 

The spell ends if the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, is rendered unconscious, or is dispersed by any means.
