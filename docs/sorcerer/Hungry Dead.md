### 📜 Description
You compel a single undead creature to abandon its normal modes of attack and savagely try to bite the nearest creature, using its teeth to the exclusion of other attacks. If the target undead does not have a bite attack, this is treated as an unarmed strike dealing piercing damage; this unarmed attack provokes an attack of opportunity unless the undead has the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. If the target undead has a bite attack, its bite attack deals 1 point of bleed damage on each hit; this bleed damage stacks if it hits the same target more than once with its bite.
