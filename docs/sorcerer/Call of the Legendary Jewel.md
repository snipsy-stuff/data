### üìú Description
A specific creature you name (a creature without a name is immune) must spend all its time stealing an object you name that does not belong to it (an object without a name cannot be the subject of the theft). Once the subject takes the object and brings it to you, the spell ends. You can force the target to act immediately or allow it to make preparations, though its every action is forced toward working towards the eventual theft. If you give the creature time you can later force it to act immediately.

The creature may have to go through threatened or dangerous areas (passing by guards or moving through an area protected by a glyph of warding) to get at the object, or it may even have to break through a barrier or pick a lock. The spell ends immediately if there is no chance that the creature can physically reach the object - including a situation forcing the creature to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it.

For example, a creature with only 30 hp that must swim through acid to reach the object is unaffected by the spell. While under the effects of protection from evil or a similar spell, the subject can ignore the compulsion, but such a ward does not prevent establishing call of the legendary jewel, nor dispel it.
