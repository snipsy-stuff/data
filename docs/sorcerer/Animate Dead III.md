### üìú Description
This spell temporarily infuses the remains of a once-living creature with negative energy, animating it in a mockery of its former life. The resulting undead creature acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions within the limits of the creature to obey or understand.

The spell animates one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying table. You choose which kind of undead to animate, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.

To animate a particular type of undead, the correct remains must be available for each creature created. Remains must be mostly intact. A soul is present in any corporeal remains for which the creature has not been resurrected or previously animated as an undead. A soul can also be obtained from trap the soul, magic jar, or similar magic.

Unlike most spells, line of effect is not required to animate the remains, as long as their location is known. This allows a body to be animated in its grave.

An animated undead cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, create spawn, or use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.

When you use an animation spell to create an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water subtype creature, it is a spell of that type. Within the area of a desecrate spell, the duration of animate dead I is doubled.
