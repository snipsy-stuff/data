### 📜 Description
This spell is identical to a dispel magic for the purpose of countering spells as they are being cast. When casting this spell, make a standard level check; success means the spell is countered and you gain 2 hp per level of the countered spell.

If you exceed the level check by five or more, the spell is still successfully countered, and you may forego the healing effect and absorb the spell being cast instead. You gain the ability to cast the spell absorbed as an appropriately prepared spell slot. You must use this spell or write it into your spellbook in the next 24 hours; otherwise, you lose it from your memory. You may only write leeched spells to your spellbook if they are on your class list.
