### 📜 Description
You transmit force siphoned straight from the earth to slam the target into the ground, even if it is flying. A creature that fails its save is knocked prone and takes 1d6 hp damage/2 caster levels (maximum 10d6). A flying creature additionally takes falling damage (1d6/10 ft. it falls). A creature that makes its saving throw takes half damage and is not knocked prone.
