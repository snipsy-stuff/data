### 📜 Description
This spell transfers your bad luck to another. You nominate a creature within range to be the scapegoat, or recipient. If the target fails its saving throw, the two of you are linked. While the spell is in effect, if you fail an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, you may transfer that failed roll to the scapegoat and roll again. You cannot transfer more than two rolls and must accept the results of your second roll. Once you have successfully transferred the two rolls to the scapegoat, the next two attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks the scapegoat makes uses the result of your die rolls before your own modifiers. If the target has yet to take an action that would use the transferred rolls (for instance, if the scapegoat chooses to move instead of attacking), you cannot transfer another poor roll to him. You may transfer a maximum of one poor roll per three caster levels to the scapegoat by use of this spell.
