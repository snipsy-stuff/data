### 📜 Description
This spell marks the target as either an enemy or friend of the dark folk. Beyond merely marking the target, dark brand has a tangible effect depending on your choice: A target marked as a friend gains a +4 profane bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks dealing with dark folk, while one marked as a foe incurs a -2 penalty on saving throws against dark folk spells or effects. Additionally, a target designated as a foe sheds light per faerie fire that only creatures possessing darkvision can see.

Creatures able to read Dark Folk understand the brand's meaning. In bright light, the brand created by this spell becomes invisible and the faerie fire effect is suspended.
