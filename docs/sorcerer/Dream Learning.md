### 📜 Description
A sleeping creature you touch studies a subject of your choice while it sleeps. The target learns what you know about one subject, and nothing more. The creature learns as much during sleep as it would during a full day of instruction, but it cannot learn anything that it could not learn while awake. In other words, while you can teach arithmetic to a sleeping human, you cannot teach it to a sleeping dog. You grant an insight bonus equal to your ranks in the chosen skill (maximum +10); you grant this bonus for the duration of the spell or until you sleep again. Subjects can only gain the benefits of one dream learning at one time.
