### 📜 Description
You inspire a righteous and potent wrath in your allies (including yourself), but cause your enemies to suffer a blinding and detrimental rage. When you cast this spell, a red haze fills the affected area but dissipates quickly, and the eyes of affected creatures momentarily glow with a maniacal red light. Your allies each gain a +2 inherent bonus to Strength and Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. They also suffer a -2 penalty on AC. (This effect is different than a barbarian's rage ability, though, so creatures can still perform actions requiring focus and concentration.) This wrath is focused on enemies at hand.

Your opponents have the same feelings of intense anger and a focused desire to do harm to their enemies. However, unlike the controlled wrath of your allies, this fury impedes opponents' prowess in battle. Opponents under the influence of this spell cannot be compelled to leave combat by any means (including a suggestion or dominate person spell) and resist efforts to physically remove them. They take a -2 inherent penalty on Strength and Constitution, and a -2 morale penalty on Will saves. In addition, affected creatures cannot perform a task or use an ability that requires focus or concentration (as per a barbarian's rage ability).

All affected creatures still recognize allies and enemies.
