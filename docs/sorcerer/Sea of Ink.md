### üìú Description
By spilling a sea of ink on the ground and stirring concentric circles into it, the caster creates an inky morass similar to quicksand.

The caster may choose to make the sinkhole move of its own accord, at a maximum speed of 20 ft./round, up to the spell's range. The sinkhole is 20 ft. deep; when the spell ends, the sinkhole disappears. Anything within it appears on the ground's surface (no longer beneath it) and covered in ink.

Creatures that enter the sinkhole's area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or begin to sink (treat as pinned). On the second round, a sinking creature may make an Escape Artist or Strength check as a full-round action to free itself (DC equal to this spell's DC). Failure means creature remains pinned. On the third round, the creature may retry the Escape Artist or Strength check as a full-round action. Failure means the creature begins to drown.

A drowning creature may try to free itself each round on its turn by attempting an Escape Artist or Strength check as a full-round action. A failed save indicates the creature sinks 5 ft. deeper. (For every 5 ft. sunk, the creature must make a check to move 5 ft. up. Success on a check at the top of the sinkhole frees the creature.)

Helping the creature by throwing it a rope grant a +2 bonus to its check attempt, plus the total Strength modifier of the creature(s) pulling it free. A fly spell automatically frees a trapped creature.

A grease spell used in conjunction increases all DCs by +2. Use of illusory script with sea of ink creates an invisible sinkhole that resembles regular ground (Perception DC 24 to detect).
