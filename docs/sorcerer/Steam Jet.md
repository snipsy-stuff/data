### 📜 Description
A blast of high-pressure steam erupts from your hand, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within its area (half bludgeoning damage, half fire damage, Reflex save for half). In addition to soaking creatures in scalding water, the jet heats their equipment, dealing an additional 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels the following round to any creatures that fail their Reflex saves. Any cold effects operating in the area that are intense enough to deal damage negate the extra fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Creatures in the jet may be knocked down or pushed back if they fail their saves. Tiny or smaller creatures are knocked down and rolled to the end of the jet plus 1d4 x 10 feet if standing on the ground, or are blown back to the end of the jet plus 2d6 x 10 feet if flying. Small creatures are knocked down and rolled to the end of the jet plus 1d3 x 10 feet by the force of the water, or are blown to the end of the jet plus 2d4 x 10 feet if flying. Medium creatures are knocked prone by the force of the steam, or if flying are blown to the end of the jet plus 1d4 x 10 feet. Large creatures are knocked prone if standing, or are blown to the end of the jet plus 1d3 x 10 feet if flying. Huge or larger creatures aren't moved or knocked down by the spell.
