### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, energy lances from your hands and traces a circle on the ground. Anyone within the circle and who can hear the song at the time of casting is trapped within it and suffers 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round that they are trapped within the circle (this spell cannot deal lethal damage). Trapped individuals can take any sort of normal action, but they cannot leave the circle (even spells such as teleport and plane shift fail). Those making their saving throw, or those entering the circle later, can leave the circle and suffer no damage. If the caster enters the circle, the spell ends.
