### 📜 Description
You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future that assists with your spell casting against a singular opponent who has resisted your spellcasting. You can only cast this spell after a singular opponent makes a successful save against one of your spells. Your next spell that targets that same opponent (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +1 insight bonus to the save DC. Omen casting places high demands on the caster's ability to predict the future, if an opponent makes his save against the spell you cast after omen casting, you cannot cast omen casting again until after you've prepared your spells again.
