### 📜 Description
This spell functions as fireball, except that you create burning chunks of earth that deal 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) to all those in the area. Half of this damage is fire damage, while the other half is bludgeoning damage (and is therefore not reduced by fire resistance, but is affected by damage reduction).
