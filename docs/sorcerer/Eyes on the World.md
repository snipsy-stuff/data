### 📜 Description
This spell grants you immediate mental awareness whenever trespassers violate the warded area or when a warded object or creature is being threatened. The spell provides a clear, mental picture of what is transpiring. For instance, if a thief has broken into your protected stronghold, you receive a clear image of the interloper as he moves through the protected area. Similarly if a creature or object is threatened by a horde of trolls, you would also see the trolls. If you cast the spell on an area, you can be anywhere within the affected area when you cast the spell. If you cast the spell on a creature or object, you must touch the target during casting. Although it is fairly simple to adjudicate when a trespasser has violated a particular area, a threat to a particular creature or object is more difficult to define. In broad terms, whenever the spell's target is within the line of sight of any creature, entity or being intent on doing it imminent harm, it is being threatened. You receive the mental images for as long as the threat or transgression lasts. The act of receiving and interpreting these mental images requires concentration. If you cease concentrating and focus your attention elsewhere, the transmission of the images stops until you resume concentrating on the spell. The spell also ends if the trespasser leaves the warded area, the threat to the creature or object has been eliminated or the creature or object has been killed or destroyed. You can only protect one area, creature or object at any given time. If detected, the protected area, object or creature radiates a strong aura of abjuration magic.
