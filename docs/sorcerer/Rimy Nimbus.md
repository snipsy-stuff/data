### 📜 Description
You create a menacing cloud towering nearby, and upon your command it disgorges a torrent of icicles and frost. The frigid torrent deals 1d6 hp cold damage per level (maximum 10d6) within the spell area. Unattended objects also take this damage.

The rimy nimbus forms within 60 ft. of you and 100 ft. above you (but you may move it out to the full range of the spell). As a free action, you may unleash the cold torrent of a rimy nimbus on the area it hovers above. The cold damage is instantaneous. Once the torrent occurs, the spell ends and the rimy nimbus disperses.

As a swift action, you may direct the cloud to move horizontally at a speed of 60 ft. per round.  Its cold damage decreases by one die for each round that it does not unleash its torrent. If the spell duration ends before the torrent is released, the nimbus unleashes its remaining damage at its present location.

A flying creature takes 2d6 hp cold damage each round it passes through or stays within the rimy nimbus. The cloud occupies a 20-ft. radius and is 40 ft. tall. The nimbus cannot move into an area occupied by a solid object, such as a building or mountain (though it can compress somewhat to pass through a 10-ft.-wide or 20-ft.-tall space). An interposing barrier takes 2d6 hp cold damage per round spent in contact with the spell, and if it shatters or breaks from this damage, the rimy nimbus may continue beyond the barrier; otherwise any solid barrier can hold the cloud back.

A severe wind (31+ mph) will disperse a rimy nimbus, but it releases its torrent at half its current strength over a 40 ft. radius by 100 ft. high cylinder before it disappears.
