### 📜 Description
You call into existence a vaguely shaped, shadowy beast that stands about knee high. The beast is silent, amorphous in shape, can spread itself out like a cloak or sail to cover a large area, and leap to interpose attacks from above. It places itself between the caster and the most apparent danger, even when threatened by invisible, flanking, or otherwise unseen attackers you are unaware of, and cannot be fooled or magically contacted.

This magical guardian beast blocks damage from the next successful attack made against you, absorbing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum of 8d6). No matter how much or how little damage is actually inflicted by the attack, the guardian beast winks out of existence as soon as it prevents damage from one attack, any excess damage is still taken by the caster. The effect also only prevents damage; any additional effects of an attack are not prevented (for example the effect of a vorpal weapon). 

A guardian beast cannot prevent damage dealt by area effect spells or similar effects. For example, it can prevent damage from a single magic missile but not multiples or from a fireball.
