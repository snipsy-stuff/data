### 📜 Description
You tap into the target creature's subconscious mind, releasing its darkest, most primitive, and most violent self. On a failed save, the creature finds itself engulfed it in a waking nightmare of violence and self-loathing, experiencing the effects of the confused condition; also on a failed save, id assassin deals 1 point of Wisdom damage each round, and in addition, the victim suffers 1d6 points of subdual damage each round as the result of its inner turmoil. A successful save results in the target being sickened for 1 round, no Wisdom damage and only half the subdual damage for the duration of the spell.
