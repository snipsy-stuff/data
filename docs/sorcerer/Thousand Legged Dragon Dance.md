### 📜 Description
You craft a small horde of rampaging dragons sculpted from fire that spread out from the center. The dragons charge over anything standing within the spell's radius. The spell inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level (15d6 maximum).

Characters who fail their saves are knocked prone regardless of size and flammable objects catch fire, including flammable characters who failed their saving throws.
