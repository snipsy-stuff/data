### üìú Description
This spell can be used in several ways. You can warp the target‚Äôs flesh in a manner similar to fleshcurdle, but inflicting one additional effect for every 4 caster levels, up to a maximum of six effects at 20th level. You may choose to impair the target‚Äôs offense or movement more than once; however, each time you must choose a different natural weapon or a different form of movement. The effects do not stack.

Alternatively, you may bestow a permanent mutation upon the target, determined randomly from the following table. Regardless of which mutation occurs, it is accompanied by a permanent deformity wracks body, mind, and soul, dealing 2 points of Charisma drain to the target. If you are using the Madness rules, the target also gains 1d3 points of Madness for each mutation it possesses. The type of mutation gained is determined randomly by rolling 1d20; however, the caster can add or subtract 1 from the result for every 5 caster levels. A creature cannot gain the same mutation more than once, regardless of whether it is harmful or beneficial, unless the mutation affects a single appendage, in which case it can be gained once for each appendage, affecting each one separately.

1: Oversized Limb: One of the target‚Äôs limbs becomes unnaturally large and strong. If the target has a claw, slam, or tentacle attack with that limb, its damage is increased as if the target were one size category larger. In addition, the mutant can wield weapons one size category larger than normal without any penalty and gains a +2 bonus to Strength checks made with that limb.

2: Oversized Maw: The target gains a bite attack dealing 1d4 points of damage (if the target is Medium-sized, 1d3 if Small and adjusted as appropriate for targets of other sizes). If the target already has a bite attack, it deals damage as if it were one size category larger.

3: Quick Metabolism: The target gains a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves, increased to +4 vs. poison, (but takes a -4 penalty on Fortitude saves to avoid the effects of starvation and thirst).

4: Thick Skin: The target‚Äôs natural armor bonus to Armor Class improves by +2.

5: Vestigial Limb: The target gains a vestigial third arm. This arm can hold objects but cannot wield them; however, it grants the target a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.

6: Vestigial Twin: A malformed twin‚Äôs head juts out from the target‚Äôs trunk (usually but not always near the target‚Äôs existing neck), providing the with the all-around vision special quality.

7: Night Sight: The target gains low-light vision, though he has a 50% chance to acquire light sensitivity 1d4 days later. Casting remove blindness/deafness or an equivalent effect removes both the light sensitivity and low-light vision.

8: Gills: The target sprouts gills that allow him to breathe water, with a 50% chance to gain the amphibious special quality, able to breathe air and water equally well. If the target does not become amphibious, however, his gills interfere with his normal breathing apparatus causing him to become fatigued as long as he remains outside of water.

9: Cave Sight: The target gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet, though he has a 50% chance to acquire light blindness 1d4 days later. Casting remove blindness/ deafness or an equivalent effect removes both the light blindness and darkvision.

10: Tail: The target grows a tail. While not prehensile, the tail grants a +2 bonus on Climb checks and Acrobatics checks made to keep his balance and to his CMD against bull rush, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers.

11: Deformed Hand:{/b{ One forelimb becomes crippled, able to hold items but not wield them. The target takes a -2 penalty on Climb and Swim checks and on attack rolls with two-handed weapons, including ranged weapons such as bows and firearms (not including pistols). A shield can still be strapped to the deformed arm, but its shield bonus to Armor Class is reduced by 1. The target has a 20% spell failure chance when casting spells with somatic components. Any natural attack involving the affected limb is made with a -2 penalty on attack rolls, and damage is reduced as if the attacker were one size category smaller.

12: Glass Jaw: The target takes a -2 penalty to its Armor Class against attack rolls made to confirm a critical hit. It also takes a -2 penalty to saving throws related to critical hits, death from massive damage, ability damage, ability drain, or becoming stunned or staggered. Whenever the target would take nonlethal damage, 50% of that damage becomes lethal damage instead.

13: Light Sensitive: The target gains the light sensitivity special quality.

14: Obese: The target takes a ‚Äì2 penalty to Dexterity (minimum score of 1) and takes the penalties for carrying a medium load (maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class +3, armor check penalty -3) even when
