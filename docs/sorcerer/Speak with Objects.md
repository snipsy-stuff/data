### 📜 Description
You can comprehend and communicate telepathically with manufactured objects, including animated objects and constructs. You are able to ask questions and receive answers from objects. An inanimate object's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give or recognize detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make animated objects or constructs any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, they are likely to make inane comments. If an animated object or construct is friendly toward the caster, it may do some favor or service for the caster (as determined by the GM).
