### 📜 Description
This spell eradicates genetic impurities, purging the target’s cellular essence of taint and mutation. Genetic purification eliminates disease from the target without the need for a caster level check; however, supernatural diseases or diseases that are also curses are removed only temporarily and may recur if the curse or supernatural effect that caused the disease is not removed. This spell also negates any polymorph effect currently affecting the target; no caster level check is required, but the target is allowed a Fortitude save to resist the effect if unwilling.

The spell can also be used to permanently purge the genetic material of the target, instantaneously transforming a part-human creature such as an aasimar, half-elf, half-orc, ifrit, oread, sylph, tiefling, or undine into a full-blooded human. In terms of game statistics, the target is affected as a dead creature returned to life as a human by a reincarnate spell, including acquiring two permanent negative levels. A half-elf or half-orc can instead be polymorphed into a full-blooded elf or orc (as appropriate). Genetic purification does not affect dead creatures.

Alternatively, genetic purification can permanently removes a template that includes the “half-“ prefix, including half-celestials, half-dragons, and half-fiends. If the target creature fails its save, the target reverts to a normal creature of its type. Genetic purification does not affect other templates, whether inherited or acquired.
