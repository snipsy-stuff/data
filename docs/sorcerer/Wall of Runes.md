### üìú Description
An opaque wall covered in shimmering runes springs into existence. The runes may take on different appearances depending on the culture from which you hail-some appear as detailed hieroglyphs, others as complex cuneiform-but whatever the appearance of the wall, its effects are the same.

The wall is ephemeral and offers no physical resistance, but anyone passing through the wall must succeed at a Will save or be cursed.

Choose one of the following curses when casting this spell. The wall imposes this curse on all creatures that pass through it.

-4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks.

Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
