### 📜 Description
You create a shimmering club of pure force energy to appear in your hand or in the hand of any one creature you touch. This weapon is wielded as a club (simple weapon). It deals 1d6+1 point of damage per two caster levels (maximum +10), plus the wielder's Strength modifier. If the wielder ever relinquishes hold of the club, it dematerializes and cannot be reformed. The first time it strikes a creature with spell resistance, you make a caster level check. If you overcome the resistance, the force club works against that creature for the duration of the spell. If it fails, the beat stick dematerializes. As a force effect, this spell can affect ethereal and incorporeal creatures.
