### 📜 Description
Float allows you to hover, weightless, above any surface at a distance of about 1 ft. You may be moved by wind or you may use a pole or other means to propel yourself in any direction. Doing so is a move action and generally provides a movement rate of 5 ft.

A floating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1 penalty to attack. A float spell does not lift a creature high enough to provide a higher ground bonus.

Float does not reduce or negate falling damage in any way. Creatures stepping into a pit or off a cliff fall normally, and stop suddenly 1 ft. sooner than they would otherwise.
