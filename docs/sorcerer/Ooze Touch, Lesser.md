### 📜 Description
As ooze touch, but the range of the touch attack always remains 5 ft. more than the target's normal attack range. The pseudopod does 1d4+1 acid damage per level and has another effect that lasts for 1 round, unless otherwise noted. All saves use the caster's DC. Derro slavers often make use of potions of lesser ooze touch to capture dangerous creatures while in lightless caverns underground.
