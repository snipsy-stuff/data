### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, your face takes on aspects of a demon lord's, momentarily driving enemies mad. For the duration of this spell, you gain a gaze attack. Any foe within 30 ft. of you must make a Will save or spend its action clawing or gouging their eyes with an available weapon. The self-inflicted attack deals 1d6 hp + the foe's Strength modifier, and the creature must make a Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A successful Fort save reduces the duration of the blindness to 1d4 rounds.

Creatures that fail their Will saves must make additional Will saves each round for the duration of the spell; if they fail, they keep clawing until they permanently blind themselves. A calm emotions or successful dispel magic will end the compulsion, though creatures are still vulnerable to further exposure to the gaze attack.
