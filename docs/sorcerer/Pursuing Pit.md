### üìú Description
You create a 10-foot-by-10-foot extradimensional hole with a depth of 10 feet per two caster levels (maximum 100 feet). The pit has the ability to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it. Creatures who fall into the hole take falling damage as normal. In addition, anyone within the pit, not just those on the bottom, takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round as the pit contracts and then returns to its normal size (a successful Reflex save halves this damage). 

You must create the pit on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. You can, as a free action once per round, cause the pit to appear anywhere else within range of the spell. Any creature standing in the area where you first conjure the pit or where you conjure it again with this free action must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling into it. 

In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. 

The ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult to scale and have a Climb DC of 35. 

When the duration of the spell ends, creatures within the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface over the course of a single round.
