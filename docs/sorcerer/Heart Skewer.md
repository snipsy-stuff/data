### 📜 Description
You attempt to skewer a target's critical, internal organ of a target without penetrating its skin. With a sweeping arm motion and a powerful lunge, you thrust your hand or a piercing melee weapon toward a target. Your hand and forearm vanish, leaving a ball of roiling flesh where your elbow passes into hyperdimensional space.

With a successful incorporeal ranged touch attack, you bypass the armor and skin of the target and grip or skewer the vital organ directly. This attack ignores the target's cover bonuses, shield, natural armor, and most armor, but it does not ignore armor bonuses granted by force effects such as mage armor, bracers of armor, and elf lord's battle armor . If the target fails its save, it takes 12d6 hp damage +1 hp per level; otherwise, it takes 3d6 hp damage +1 hp per level. You withdraw your hand, and if the target dies, the target's vital organ drips gore from your grip or from the skewering tip of your weapon.
