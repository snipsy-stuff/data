### 📜 Description
You create a pale yellow slime on the target. The slime begins to devour the target's flesh rapidly, causing 1d6 points of damage per round. An undead creature may attempt a Fortitude save in the first round of the spell to reduce all damage caused by the slime by half. The application of one flask of strong alcohol or an attack that deals at least 5 points of fire damage to the target negates any further damage from the spell. A small or smaller corpse is destroyed in 1 round, a medium one in 2 rounds, a large one in 3 round for each size category above large add 2 rounds to the time it takes to destroy it.
