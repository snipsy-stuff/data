### 📜 Description
The energy of this spell creates a multicolored arcane sigil on the face, hand, or other prominent feature of the creature touched. Those bearing this sigil are protected from damage and the effects caused by prismatic effects such as those created by prismatic spray. When the spell absorbs 1 prismatic effect per 2 caster levels, mark of the prismatic ends. The spell also provides the creature touched with a special ability. The creature can move through a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere once, ignoring it as if it were not there. If the creature uses this ability, the spell ends immediately afterward. Mark of the prismatic does not grant the creature the ability to make attacks through a prismatic wall or sphere, only to move through it. Recipients also possess the ability to cast a prismatic ray from the palm of the hand that inflicts all 7 prismatic effects upon the target, if a ranged touch attack strikes the target within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). Using this prismatic ray ability is a standard action that immediately dismisses the mark of the prismatic.
