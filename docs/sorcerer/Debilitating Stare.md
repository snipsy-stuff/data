### 📜 Description
With a glance, you cause every muscle in the target's body to contract and relax in violent waves.

The target takes 1d6 hp nonlethal electricity damage, loses the ability to speak coherently, and drops anything it is holding unless it makes a Fortitude save. Spellcasters can attempt spells with verbal components with a 50% chance of spell failure; if the spell fails, it is lost.

If the Fortitude save is successful, the target takes 1d3 hp nonlethal electricity damage each round for the spell's duration, but it can still talk and does not drop held items.

If you actively concentrate on the target while this spell is in effect, you inflict a non-cumulative -2 penalty to the target's Fortitude save each round.
