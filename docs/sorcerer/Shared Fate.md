### 📜 Description
This spell generates an effect similar to a weapon enchanted with the vicious special ability. If any creature affected by this spell suffers damage (hit point or ability), every other creature affected by this spell suffers damage as well, although the amount of damage dealt to these creatures is reduced in half. Only injuries are shared in this manner, thus magical and non-magical effects that do not deal damage, such as paralysis, blindness and death effects are not shared. Self-inflicted damage is also not shared.
