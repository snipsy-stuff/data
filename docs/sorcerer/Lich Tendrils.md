### 📜 Description
You send forth whip-like tendrils of negative energy. The tendrils strike everything in their path, dealing 1d8 points of damage to living creatures, + 1 point of damage per 2 caster levels. Any living creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed; regardless of whether the save succeeds, the subjects still take full damage from the attack. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, with a DC equal to the spell's DC). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by this spell seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive. As negative energy, this damage can be used to heal undead creatures.
