### 📜 Description
The subject and all of its gear collapse into a pool of greenish liquid. The creature gains +5 AC and material armor becomes worthless, though size, Dexterity, deflection, and armor bonuses from forces still apply.

While in slime form, the creature becomes immune to sneak attacks and critical hits, but it cannot attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components, and it also loses any supernatural abilities. The creature can squeeze through any opening larger than 1 inch and gains a +20 to Climb rolls for the spell's duration. The subject's movement drops to 10 ft. per round until the spell ends.
