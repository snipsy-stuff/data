### 📜 Description
This spell enables you to see in all directions at once, granting you 60-foot darkvision and the ability to see invisibility (as the spell) within 60 feet. You gain a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks, you retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed, and you can't be flanked. However, you cannot avert your gaze or close your eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.
