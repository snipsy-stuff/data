### 📜 Description
With this spell you cause your familiar to transform into a powerful fighting machine. Your familiar increases three size categories. It gains a +12 size bonus to Strength, but suffers a -4 penalty to Dexterity. It loses whatever size bonus it had to attack and AC and gains the modifier of its new size (+0 if now Medium or -1 if now Large). The familiar's natural weapons increase in damage as appropriate to its size change. If it had no natural weapons, it gains a single natural attack (bite if it has a mouth, otherwise slam), which deals damage equal to an appropriatelysized club (1d6 if now Medium, 1d8 if Large). Your familiar also gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor and 4 temporary hit points per caster level (maximum 80).

While under the effect of this spell your familiar cannot be reduced to below 0 hit points. If an attack would reduce it to below 0 hit points, its hit point total goes to 0 and the spell immediately ends.
