### 📜 Description
You inscribe a complex diagram with rare ashes around a bloodstone, which erupts in brilliant flames as a great flaming bird rises from the conflagration. This birdlike creature resembles a giant eagle with red, orange, and white flames in place of feathers; it even has a saddle and bridle. The firebird acts immediately when it appears on your turn. It responds to simple mental commands and can be ordered to attack your enemies, bear you as a rider, or perform any other service reasonable for a creature of its type and intelligence.

You and you alone can ride the creature safely; any other creature mounted on the firebird takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round. For as long as you ride the firebird, you gain a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and fire resistance 10. In addition to its base hit points, the firebird gains +1 hp/caster level you possess.
