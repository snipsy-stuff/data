### 📜 Description
As suggestion, except the effect does not discharge and the target need not understand the caster. The caster telepathically implants the suggestion into the subject. Once the suggestion discharges, the caster can simply reissue a new suggestion (though he must touch the target again as a standard action). The caster cannot implant more than one active suggestion in a creature at a time. 

The suggestion planted must not take place immediately and is instead buried in the victim's subconscious until triggered. Its trigger must be based either on an event as it is perceived by the victim or an amount of time going by. During the period while the suggestion is buried and untriggered, neither divination spells nor Sense Motive will reveal that the subject is under the effect of an enchantment. Attempts to remove the suggestion during this period, such as with dispel magic or break enchantment, add a +20 bonus to the DC. The subject does not make his saving throw until the triggering event occurs. 

While under the effects of mind blank, or a similar spell, the subject can ignore the compulsion, but such a ward does not prevent establishing triggered agent, nor dispel it. 

A successful save against the spell inflicts an insanity spell upon the target, which requires a second save at the same DC.
