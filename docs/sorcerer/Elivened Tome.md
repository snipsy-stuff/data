### 📜 Description
You awaken your spellbook to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + your current level). The awakened spellbook is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with the spellbook you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. An enlivened spellbook has characteristics as if it were an intelligent item and an animated object (normally tiny) with bonus hit points equal to your caster level. An awakened spellbook can speak one language you know plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence (if any).

An awakened spellbook gains 3d6 Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as well as an additional 2d6 hit points. Awakened spellbooks have distinctive personalities of their own. These personalities can reflect the personality of the caster, spells contained within, or be completely random. Some examples include: cautious, crazy, curious, helpful, ornery, passionate, philosophical, or sarcastic.

Special: You may have only one awakened tome in existence at any one time.
