### 📜 Description
This spell functions as drake form I, except you can also assume the form of a Medium lesser dragon. You gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, Dexterity and Constitution, a +3 natural armor bonus, fly 60 ft. (poor), darkvision 60 ft., telepathy, and a bite attack that deals 1d8 hp damage.

Additionally, if the drake form has a breath weapon, you gain its breath weapon-albeit limited to 5 dice of damage-which allows a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal to the DC for this spell.

Addition from Drake Form II: Gain additional bonuses.
