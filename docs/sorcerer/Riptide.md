### 📜 Description
You create a wave of blue-green force that sweeps all in the affected area from their feet. All creatures in the area of effect are subject to a trip attempt.

If the DC of the spell exceeds the target's CMD, the target is knocked prone. If the target has more than two legs, increase the creature's CMD by +2 for each additional leg it has. Creatures that cannot be tripped, such as oozes, creatures without legs, and flying creatures, are not affected by this spell.

Subjects affected by this spell do not gain an attack of opportunity to trip you if they succeed in retaining their footing, although the spellcasting itself may provoke an attack of opportunity normally.
