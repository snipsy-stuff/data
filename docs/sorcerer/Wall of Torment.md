### 📜 Description
An immobile, invisible, intangible plane of pure pain springs into existence. The wall of torment deals 2d6 points of Dexterity damage and 2d6 points of Strength damage to any creature passing through it, and such creatures additionally take a -4 morale penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for the duration of the spell (or until the effect is dispelled). If you create the wall in a creature's space, the creature takes damage as if it passed through the wall. A successful save negates the damage and reduces the morale penalties to -2.

See invisibility and similar effects reveal the wall to be composed of turbulent energy.
