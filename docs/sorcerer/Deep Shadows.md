### 📜 Description
This spell creates a deepening and darkening of shadows in the area. This spell doesn't actually create shadows; it just makes existing shadows much larger and darker, and enhances them so they even interferewith low-light vision and darkvision. The shadows  affected by this spell provide one-quarter concealment to anyone within them (providing a 10% miss chance) or one-half concealment to anyone seeking the cover of the enhanced darkness (providing a 20% miss chance) as well as a +4 circumstance bonus on Hide checks. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Deep shadows is countered by any light spell of equal or greater level.
