### 📜 Description
Casting this spell encases you in a ramshackle layer of armor composed of the spell's material components. While encased, use your touch AC for all AC checks. Your armor absorbs damage before it is destroyed, effectively granting you 10 temporary hp per 100 lbs. of metal used in its construction. While the spell is in effect, you may move normally, though your strength is otherwise unaffected. Once the spell's duration is over (or the armor is destroyed), the metal component crumbles to dust.
