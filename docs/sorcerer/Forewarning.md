### 📜 Description
You look into the future and implant in the subject's subconscious (or your own mind) a thought of a specific danger that lies ahead. At two different moments while the spell remains active, the subject sees a warning in his conscious mind. This warning serves as either an insight bonus to his choice of either Armor Class or Combat Maneuver Defense, or as a luck bonus to a saving throw (in either case the bonus cannot exceed +25). Once the second warning has been used, the spell is discharged. The decision of what type of bonus and to what kind of defense must be made before any dice are rolled, at the moment of danger. 

This spell cannot be cast on a single creature more than once in a 24-hour period.
