### 📜 Description
You cause the target's pants to fall down to his ankles. 

Belts or suspenders offer no protection to the target, but armor that fully encompasses the legs, such as full plate, prevents the negative effects of this spell. 

After having his pants fall, the target can refasten his pants as a move action. If the subject does not pull up his pants, movement is reduced by half, and if he attempts to move more than five feet in a single round, he must make a Reflex save (same DC as the spell) or fall prone.
