### 📜 Description
You create a piece of text that appears normal and harmless at first glance, but poses a serious danger to anyone reading it. In this case, "reading" the script means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. 

On a successful Will save, the reader of the script of the lost is able to look away with only a slight sense of discomfort, but a failed save causes the reader to suffer from total amnesia losing the use of all spells and abilities that require an action to use; the subjects also lose access to their memories and Knowledge skills. 

Script of the lost vanishes after it affects 1 creature per caster level. You can follow a secret page spell immediately by script of the lost, so only creatures that discover the secret page are subject to the effects of this spell. 

Dispel magic and remove curse do not remove the amnesia. Greater restoration, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.
