### 📜 Description
You animate a stick or pole and use it to trip a nearby opponent. The stick can move up to 30 ft. in the first round as a free action. After the first round, you must concentrate to move the stick.  The stick attacks one enemy within 5 ft. of it on your initiative, and when it attacks, it attempts a trip maneuver with a CMB equal to your CMD + your level. This attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

The stick can be attacked, and it has hardness and hp based on its construction. Wooden sticks have hardness 5 and 5 hp. Metal staves have a hardness of 10 and 10 hp. The stick can be broken and destroyed as normal, and it can be grappled, assuming it has a CMD equal to the caster's CMB + the caster's level.
