### üìú Description
You can replicate any spell cast by another spellcaster during this encounter (subject to GM adjudication). The spell must be on a spell list from which you can cast, you must be of sufficient level to cast it, and it must not be higher than 6th level. You must make a Spellcraft check to identify the spell as you cast copycat or the spell fails. If there is a costly focus or material component (more than 10 gp) or experience component  to the copied spell, you must provide this component or the casting of copycat fails. If the replicated spell has a casting time of 1 standard action or less, the casting time for copycat is a full-round action, and the imitated spell comes into effect upon completion of the spell. If the replicated spell has a casting time of more than one standard action, the casting time for copycat equals the imitated spell's casting time plus one round.

For the copied version of the spell, you are considered to be the caster of the spell for all purposes. If the spell appears on more than one spell list from which you can cast, you may choose to cast it from any applicable spell list. The base spell is replicated by copycat, plus any applied metamagic feats, but its effective spell level still cannot be higher than 6th level.
