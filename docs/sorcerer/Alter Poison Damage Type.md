### 📜 Description
You are able to change the type of ability damage dealt by the affected poison. Poison that deals Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage may only be altered to one of the other two types. Poison that deals Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage may only be altered to one of the other two types.

When the spell ends, the poison reverts to its normal damage type.

A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison.
