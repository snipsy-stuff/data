### 📜 Description
This spell creates a single illusory double of each target. The double stands 10 to 15 ft. away from the target, as you direct. If the double appears in a position to grant a flanking bonus, the target receives the flanking bonus unless its opponent succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve the illusion.

If you create a double of yourself and the double could grant you a flanking bonus, the spell grants you a +3 flanking bonus instead of the normal +2 bonus.

Another recipient's double cannot grant you a flanking bonus. Opponents who successfully disbelieve the illusory double cannot be flanked by any of the doubles.
