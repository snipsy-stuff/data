### 📜 Description
The target can get a good night's sleep even in horrible conditions. Even wearing armor, lying on a slimy dungeon floor surrounded by corpses, a character can sleep soundly and only when the spell ends or is dismissed. This sleep is not a compulsion, however - it affects only willing targets.
