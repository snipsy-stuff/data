### 📜 Description
This spell creates an immobile wall of shimmering white light, illuminating the area within 60 ft. It does not provide any sort of barrier to entry or attack, but any undead that walk through the light take 1d8 + caster level in divine damage. Any living creature that walks through the wall is illuminated as if by a faerie fire spell for one minute/caster level. If the caster attempts to cast the wall on individual creatures, they may make Reflex saves to avoid taking damage (if undead) or being illuminated (if living). 

Wall of light counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but is only dispelled by darkness spells or effects of 4th level or higher. 

The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-ft. square per level, or into a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 ft. per level. The wall of light must be continuous and unbroken when formed.
