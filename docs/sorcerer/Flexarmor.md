### 📜 Description
Flexarmor causes a single set of armor or a shield to become more malleable and less restrictive. The target's armor check penalty is reduced by 2, +1 for every five caster levels (maximum of +6 at level 20). Its maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 1, +1 for every five caster levels (maximum increase of +5 at level 20). The arcane spell failure chance is decreased by 10%, +5% for every five caster levels (maximum decrease of 30% at level 20). This spell cannot reduce the armor check penalty or spell failure chance below 5%.
