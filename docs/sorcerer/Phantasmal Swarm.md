### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of a swarm into the subject's mind. Only the spell's subject can see the greater phantasmal swarm. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm swarm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or become nauseated from fear permanently. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 4d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal swarm attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the swarm can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
