### 📜 Description
This spell moves the target forward or backward in time but not space. Instead, space moves around the creature, depositing it directly east or west from its starting point. The target may move forward or backward 1 minute per caster level, each minute equaling 15 miles. If too close to the edge of the world, chrono location transports the target into space.

A caster who travels into the past and prevents themselves from ever casting chrono location must make a Fortitude save DC 20 as the two essences merge. A failed save destroys the caster, while a successful save renders the caster sickened and exhausted for one week.
