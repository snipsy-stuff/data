### 📜 Description
A blast of arctic wind erupts from your hand, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all creatures within its area (half bludgeoning damage, half cold damage, Reflex save for half). In addition, the blast chills their equipment, dealing an additional 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels (max 10d6) the following round to any creatures that fail their Reflex saves. Any fire effects operating in the area that are intense enough to deal damage negate the extra cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Creatures in the area may be knocked down or pushed back if they fail their saves. Medium or smaller creatures are knocked down and rolled to the end of the blast plus 1d4 x 10 feet if standing on the ground, or are blown back to the end of the blast plus 2d6 x 10 feet if flying. If flying, Medium or smaller creatures are knocked down and rolled to the end of the area plus 1d3 x 10 feet by the force of the wind, or are blown to the end of the effect plus 2d4 x 10 feet. Large creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind or, if flying, are blown to the end of the area plus 1d4 x 10 feet. Huge creatures are knocked prone if standing, or are blown to the end of the area plus 1d3 x 10 feet if flying. Gargantuan or larger creatures aren't moved or knocked down by the spell.
