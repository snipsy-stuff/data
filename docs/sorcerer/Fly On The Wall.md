### 📜 Description
This spell turns a normal insect you touch into a magical sensor. Suitable targets include bees, flies, or ants. As long as the target is within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft./level) of you, you can concentrate to activate the sensor. When you do so, you can see and hear through the sensor as if you were using clairaudience and clairvoyance. The sensor can be noticed with a successful Perception check DC 37 (observant creatures might notice a subtle pattern of the caster's eyes appearing on the insect). For the duration of the spell you can direct the movement of the insect. The spell ends immediately if the insect is damaged.
