### 📜 Description
You grant a touched Large or smaller object the ability to fly at a speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed. The targeted object flies as you direct it, using your Fly skill for any difficult maneuvers. You must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of the object to direct it, and moving it requires a move action. If not directed, the object hovers in place (no Fly check required). The maximum weight of the object and anything carried by it is 500 pounds per caster level (maximum 10,000 pounds).
