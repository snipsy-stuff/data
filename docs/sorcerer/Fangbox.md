### 📜 Description
This rather vicious spell transforms a container into a hateful, fanged monster for a short period of time. Kobold spellcasters often use this spell to wreak havoc among adventurers by turning handy haversacks and scroll cases into biting horrors.

While transmuted, any items held in the case may be accessed by a standard action even if the action would regularly be a free, swift, or move action; when an item is retrieved from it, the fangbox gets an attack of opportunity. A fangbox gets a base attack equal to 5+ your level and has a bite attack (see damage table below). A Strength check (DC 10 + your level) is required to retrieve an item from the fangbox.

Each round on your initiative, the fangbox attacks one creature adjacent to it. If a creature retrieved an item from it and stands adjacent to it, the fangbox always attacks that creature. The fangbox cannot move.

The fangbox deals damage based on its size and the level of the caster.
