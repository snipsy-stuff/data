### 📜 Description
The outline of the target of this spell becomes blurred as though seen through a thick and opaque glass. This distortion grants the subject total concealment (50% miss chance). A true seeing spell counters the effects of opaque haze, although see invisibility does not. This spell has no effect on creatures that cannot see the recipient of this spell.
