### 📜 Description
A specific creature you name (a creature without a name is immune) must immediately go to its home. Once the subject arrives home, the spell ends. Creatures with no home or lair cannot be affected by this spell, although even a regular place to sleep could be considered a "home."

The creature may have to traverse threatened or dangerous areas (passing by hostile beasts or moving through a cloudkill) to get home, or it may even have to break through a barrier (like a wall of ice). A barrier that requires more than 5 rounds to get through is considered impassable for the purposes of this spell. The spell ends immediately if the creature physically cannot reach its home - including a situation forcing the creature to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it. For example, a creature with only 25 hp that must navigate a pool of acid to get home is unaffected by the spell, as is a creature with no planar travel ability whose home is on another plane.

While under the effects of protection from evil or a similar spell, the subject can ignore the compulsion, but such a ward does not prevent establishing call of the sapphire, nor dispel it.
