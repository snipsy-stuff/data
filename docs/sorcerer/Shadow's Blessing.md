### 📜 Description
The recipient of this spell enjoys several benefits depending on the illumination level. In bright light, the recipient gains no bonuses from shadow's blessing. In normal light, the recipient gains a +2 morale bonus on Stealth checks and imposes a 10% miss chance on other creatures that attack the recipient, as the spell provides a lesser form of concealment.

In dim light, the recipient gains a +4 morale bonus on Stealth checks and increases the miss chance from concealment with respect to him to 30%. In darkness, the recipient gains a +6 morale bonus on Stealth checks and imposes a 10% miss chance on creatures with darkvision that attack the recipient (there is no additional miss chance for creatures without darkvision).
