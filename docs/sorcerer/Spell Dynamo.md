### 📜 Description
You can 'siphon' off the power of any failed or discharged spell within 100 ft. to power a 3rd level spell or lower that you know or is in your spellbook. This 3rd level or lower spell is stored for 1 round/level and requires a move action to direct. You cannot "power" more than two spells per round (taking two move actions) and the failed or discharged spell must at least be of equal or greater level than the one being "powered." This spell does not count against the number of quickened spells you can use in a round. A failed spell is a spell that is failed due to a failed concentration check, caster level check (failing to overcome spell resistance), or a successful save that negates a spell's effect (partial effects do not provide enough power). Discharged spells are spells that list "until discharged" in their duration and have met the requirement for that discharge, for example see the spell guidance.
