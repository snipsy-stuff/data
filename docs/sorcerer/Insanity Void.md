### 📜 Description
You hurl all creatures in the area of effect into a black, starless void. Characters trapped in the void can breathe normally and gain the effects of a fly spell while in the void. While affected by insanity void, each character is driven temporarily insane by the unknowably vast immensity of the surrounding nothingness. Such characters act as if under the effects of a confusion spell while in the void.

Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane (such as teleport) do not help a creature escape the insanity void, but a plane shift spell returns the subject to the spot it occupied before being cast into the void. Characters returning from the void appear in the spot they occupied when the spell was cast. If this location is filled by a solid object, they appear in the nearest open space. Characters returning from the void are dazed for 1 round by the strangeness of their experience.
