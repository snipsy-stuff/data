### 📜 Description
The target elf you touch undergoes a rapid change, transforming into an orc. The target's type changes to humanoid (orc), and it loses all elf traits (including lowlight vision, bonuses, proficiencies, and immunities) but gains all of the orc character traits, and has its alignment changed to evil with no desire to change back into an elf.
