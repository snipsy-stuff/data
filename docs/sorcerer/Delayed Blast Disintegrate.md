### 📜 Description
A delayed blast disintegrate spell generates a green sphere within which all matter is destroyed. A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger to the middle of the desired blast radius. Any creature within the blast radius takes 2d6 hp damage per caster level (maximum 40d6).

Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hp by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A creature that dies in this manner cannot be the target of raise dead, although resurrection and other powerful effects still work. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. The effect can be delayed for up to 5 rounds, in this case, the area glows green until the effect is triggered.

All unattended, nonliving, non-magical objects within the blast radius are simply disintegrated (including walls and floors). Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The blast affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as forceful hand or a wall of force, but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability or antimagic field.

Creatures or objects that makes a successful Fortitude save are partially affected, taking only 5d6 hp damage and they are staggered for 1 round. If this damage reduces them to 0 or fewer hp, they are disintegrated.

The spell is distinctive in that a loud percussive boom always rattles the area after the spell goes off, as air rushes in to fill the sudden vacuum.
