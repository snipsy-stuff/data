### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, the target creatures are propelled 10 feet per caster level through the air in a single direction you choose and then are forced to land on the ground hard unless the ground is out of range of the effect. The target suffers 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6) from battering and the hard landing (half damage if the ground is out of range of the effect). At the end of the movement, the creatures are knocked prone.

Creatures do not interfere in any way with the target's flight pattern, but solid barriers such as walls and doors might. Should the target encounter a solid barrier, the target deals damage to the barrier equal to the amount of damage dealt to the target by the spell (minus its hardness). Should the damage be equal to or greater than the barrier's total hit points, the target bursts through the barrier and continues on its path.

If the target succeeds on its saving throw, it negates the flung and knocked prone effects but does suffer half damage.
