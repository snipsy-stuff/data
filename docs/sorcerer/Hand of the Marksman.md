### 📜 Description
You gain a limited precognition that allows you to aim your attacks more precisely. Your next ranged attack roll made with a firearm or crossbow (if it is made before the end of the next round) automatically hits and is considered a critical threat. You must still make an attack roll to confirm the critical threat.
