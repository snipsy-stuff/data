### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, you create a twinkling, beguiling section of night sky replete with countless stars 20 ft. above the ground (or just below the ceiling if the ceiling is lower than 20 ft. high). When cast outside, this reduces the light level by two steps in the area of affect.

The twinkling stars hold the attention of creatures viewing them from within the area of affect. Creatures in the area of effect stare at the twinkling stars and are fascinated (as the condition) by them. Affected creatures become drowsy and in the subsequent round must make an additional Will saving throw or fall asleep as deep slumber.

Sightless creatures and creatures that do not require sleep are immune to beguiling stars. Creatures immune to sleep effects can be fascinated by this spell but do not fall asleep as deep slumber.
