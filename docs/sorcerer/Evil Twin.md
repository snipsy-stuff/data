### 📜 Description
This spell creates an exact duplicate of a target creature which immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and her items disappear completely. Only a single duplicate of an individual can exist at any one time, including one created by a mirror of opposition. 

The motives of the duplicate, if needed, are determined by the GM. The duplicate isn't a character or creature, per se, and so has no alignment (though any items, spells, etc. the duplicate may have that function only for individuals of a certain alignment function normally for the duplicate while the duplicate exists).
