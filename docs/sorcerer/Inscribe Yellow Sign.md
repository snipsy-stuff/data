### üìú Description
By smearing the prepared materials onto a surface, you cause them to combine, twisting and writhing, issuing puffs of acrid smoke, until they finally coalesce into a disturbing sigil that glows with a malevolent saffron hue. This is a potent version of the Yellow Sign, the symbol of the Unspeakable One.

All evil spells cast within 30 feet of the Yellow Sign are cast at +1 caster level. Any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that gazes upon the sigil automatically gains 1 insanity point and must succeed on a Will saving throw against the spell‚Äôs DC or gain 1d4 additional insanity points, plus 1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d4+10). Creatures that fail this save by 5 or more become shaken for 10 rounds, while those that fail by 10 or more are panicked for 10 rounds and then shaken for 1d10 hours thereafter.

Creatures of the animal type, while not subject to the insanity points imposed by the spell, will not willingly approach within 30 feet of the Yellow Sign; if forced to do so, they become panicked for as long as they remain within 30 feet.

Special You must have 5 or more insanity points to cast the spell.
