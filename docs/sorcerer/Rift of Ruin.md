### üìú Description
This spell tears a rift in reality, creating an extradimensional hole with a depth of 60 feet. You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface‚Äîyou can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must make a Reflex save to avoid falling into the rift. If the Reflex save is successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects or structures fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.

The walls of the rift are covered by razor-sharp blades, while the rift floor seethes with strange chewing vermin, boiling pools of acid, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the pit takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the pit (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the pit‚Äôs environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the pit rather than at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round, and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the pit can make a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The pit‚Äôs walls have a Climb DC of 25.

When this spell‚Äôs duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift‚Äôs environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.

At any time during the spell‚Äôs duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens out into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell‚Äôs duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area‚Äîthese Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via summon monster VII, and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the rift of ruin spell. You can choose one of the following to be summoned: 1 bebilith, 1 vrock, 1d3 succubi, 1d3 shadow demons, 1d4+1 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraks.
