### 📜 Description
You make yourself and all your gear appear as a featureless, genderless humanoid statue of pale stone, smooth in appearance yet coarse to the touch, seeming to crumble slightly into drifts of dust when strongly struck. You gain a +5 bonus to Stealth checks in areas of natural stone or rubble and a +10 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to hide small objects on your person. A creature that interacts with the glamer, including attacking or being attacked by you, gets a Will save to recognize the faceless disguise as an illusion.

A faceless disguise, however, is a double illusion. Creatures seeing through the outer illusion instead perceive you as an emaciated, naked, genderless, hairless, eye-less, nose-less, many-toothed, slick, clay-colored humanoid of indeterminate age. The only distinguishing marks which appear upon the illusion at all are a series of shifting, jagged geometric diagrams in lieu of a face. Those perceiving this second illusion are filled with horror and revulsion, taking a -2 penalty to Charisma for 1 hour (Will negates); this penalty is doubled for creatures sharing your type and subtype. This is a mind-affecting effect, and creatures with Intelligence of 2 or less are immune. Those making their second save see through both layers of the illusion and suffer no ill effects from interacting with you.
