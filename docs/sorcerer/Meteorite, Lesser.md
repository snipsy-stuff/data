### 📜 Description
Lesser meteorite evokes a piece of celestial matter and rains it down upon a foe. When you cast it, the lesser meteorite appears as high above the target as the immediate environment allows (raining down from the sky if no ceiling). The mundane meteorite streaks down with an orange glow, leaving a visible tail and audible thunder in its wake. Make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteorite. Any creature struck by the meteorite receives no saving throw and takes 12d6 points of damage from the impact. If a targeted meteorite misses its target, it simply explodes at that point. Once a meteorite strikes, it explodes in a 20-foot-radius spread (similar to a fireball's) that deals 4d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area (Reflex save for half damage).
