### 📜 Description
This spell renders you invisible and gives one adjacent creature you choose the illusion of your appearance. The creature glamered does not know this has happened unless it makes a Will save, and it must rely on the reactions of others around them to become aware of the effect. If the target fails a save but begins to suspect the illusion affecting it, it may make a Spellcraft check on its turn to learn the truth. The DC for this check is equal to the spells' DC.

Creatures that witness the illusion may make Intelligence or Spellcraft checks to figure out what is going on (DC equal to this spell's DC).

Less-intelligent foes may well become confused and attack their ally. After interacting with the glamer, a creature may make a standard Will saves to disbelieve the illusion.
