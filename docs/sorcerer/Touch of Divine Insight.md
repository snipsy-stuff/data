### 📜 Description
This spell is a dangerous divination at best but its effect is often well worth the risk. It grants the caster a sudden, intuitive knowledge of the essence and true name of a chosen deity. This can be any deity the caster knows of and does not need to be of a compatible alignment. Once cast, the knowledge gained by this spell grants the caster the ability to "trade out" spells for any spell from any of the deity's domains of the same level, similar to the cleric's Spontaneous Casting ability. Each time this is done, the caster must make a Concentration check (DC 30) or touch of divine insight ends immediately after the traded spell is cast. 

The knowledge of the deity's true name is a subtle and intuitive one. It cannot be imparted through any form of communication and cannot be put to any other use. Once the spell ends, the knowledge disappears completely.
