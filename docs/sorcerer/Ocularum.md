### 📜 Description
You can paint a glyph with the clear fluids extracted from the eye of any living creature, creating a potent scrying tool.

As a full-round action, you can attune yourself to any such glyph you have created that is within a range of 1 mile/level. After that round, you see out of that glyph as if you were physically present at that location, including any enhanced vision such as darkvision and see invisibility. You cannot use any senses other than vision through the ocularum.

The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a DC 20 Perception check to locate. It has 1 hp, and if the glyph is destroyed while you are actively looking through it, you are immediately and permanently blinded. While actively scrying through the glyph, you become unaware of your own surroundings, receiving a -10 penalty to all Perception checks in your actual location and easily surprised. This spell only functions on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.
