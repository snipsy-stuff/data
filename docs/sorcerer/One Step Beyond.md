### 📜 Description
The targets protected by this abjuration remain completely immune to divination spells of any level, including discern location and even a wish or miracle spell used as a divination. Similar to mind blank, this spell provides foolproof protection against scrying and mind-reading attempts of any kind, and the subjects cannot be seen with a spell like arcane eye. An invisible character protected by this spell would also not be seen by see invisibility or true seeing spell.
