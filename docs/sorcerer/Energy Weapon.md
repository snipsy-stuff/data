### 📜 Description
Casting this spell sheaths one weapon in one of five energy types of the caster's choice (acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic). For the duration of the spell, the enchanted weapon deals an additional 1d6 damage of the energy type chosen on a successful hit. The elemental energy imbued does not harm the caster, or the weapon, but it may affect surrounding objects (for example, a flaming sword could be used to ignite a pool of oil).
