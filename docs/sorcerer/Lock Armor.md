### 📜 Description
Lock armor makes metal cling to metal as though soldered or rusted through, making it impossible to move the pieces against one another. This effectively paralyzes a creature in any form of metal armor, although speech is still possible.

The effect is negated if the armor can be removed by a compatriot. In addition, the creature in armor gains a Will save each round to overcome the effect. A creature wearing a chain shirt, breastplate, or other metal armor that only covers part of the body can still move but cannot attack or effectively defend itself. Animated metal constructs are completely paralyzed and unable to speak.

Each round, a construct affected by this spell may use a full-round action and roll a new Will save to end the effect, without provoking attacks of opportunity. A winged construct affected by lock armor cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and might drown. Grease counters and dispels lock armor.
