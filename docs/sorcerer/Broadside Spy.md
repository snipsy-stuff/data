### 📜 Description
This spell turns a single piece of paper (or similar material) you touch into a magical sensor. Suitable targets include wanted posters, notices, or letters.

As long as the target is within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) of you, you can concentrate to activate the sensor. When you do so, you can see through the sensor as if looking through a window. The sensor within the paper can be noticed as usual (observant creatures might notice a subtle pattern of eyes appearing in the written material). The spell ends immediately if the paper is damaged. This spell can be made permanent with a permanency spell (min. CL 14th, 15,000 gp).
