### 📜 Description
This spell covers a single Small or Medium humanoid with a specific glamer of either a large boulder or a pile of rubble or trash (caster's choice). The boulder or trash is of an appropriate type for the terrain and situation. This spell grants a +20 to Stealth as long as the waiting creature takes no actions of any type, including free actions. Typically, ambushers have their weapons drawn when the spell is cast. If the illusion is touched or is the target of a spell, effect or attack, anyone who sees the illusion ripple slightly from the touch gains a Will save to disbelieve.
