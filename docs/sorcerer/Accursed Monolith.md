### üìú Description
This spell is sometimes used by researchers into the mysteries of the ancients as a means to examine the architecture and artistry of fallen obelisks, statuary, and similar monuments. Eldritch monolith creates a solid illusory duplicate of the exterior of the ancient structure used as its focus, resized and proportionately scaled down to fit within the spell‚Äôs area. This spell shows external openings but not the internal structure of the building; however, spaces open to the exterior are visible. The detail shown by the eldritch monolith is not exacting, but it does provide a +2 circumstance bonus to Knowledge checks about the actual structure. The caster can create an eldritch ancient monolith of his own design or from a blend of actual buildings (a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) or Knowledge (history) check reveals this fabrication).

Elder cultists sometimes replicate ancient buildings, especially blasphemous edifices torn down by the supposedly enlightened faithful of the younger gods. The caster can also create an eldritch monolith of his own design, whether conventional or wholly alien, often accounting for madmens‚Äô tales of alien vistas and unearthly buildings that vanish without a trace when others try to substantiate their ravings. If a caster attempts to create a counterfeit of an existing building, a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) or Knowledge (history) check reveals the fabrication.

An eldritch monolith is solid and can be climbed (DC 20) or used to provide cover. While it has the appearance of solid stone (Will disbelief), its hardness is 2, and each 5-cubic section has hit points equal to your level. Destruction of one section does not affect other sections.
