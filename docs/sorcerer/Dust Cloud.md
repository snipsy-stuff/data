### üìú Description
You create a roiling cloud of dust that rises from the ground to a height of 20 feet. Living creatures within the area must make a successful Fortitude save or be blinded for as long as they remain in the cloud and for 1 round thereafter. The cloud obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance), while creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). The squares containing the cloud are difficult terrain (each square moved counts as two squares of movement, with each diagonal counting as three squares). The churning dust makes spellcasting difficult, requiring a Concentration check (DC 10 + your caster level plus the relevant spellcasting ability modifier). 

You can make the cloud twice as tall by making it half as wide (20-foot-radius spread, 40 feet high). As move action, you can direct it to move along the ground up to 20 feet each round.
