### üìú Description
The subject can see into and through solid matter. At a range of 20 feet, the subject can see as if it were looking at something in normal light - even if there is none. For example, if the subject looks into a locked chest, it can see inside even if there's no light within. X-ray vision can penetrate matter based on the type of material and the caster's level:

Substance               *Thickness                        Maximum Scanned                    Per Round                        Thickness

Organic matter       2 feet/5 levels                   2 feet/level (animal)

Organic matter      1 foot/5 levels                   2 feet/level (vegetable)

Stone                       6 inches/5 levels              1 foot/level

Iron, steel, and      Half-inch/5 levels              1 inch/level so on

Lead, gold,              Cannot penetrate               N/A platinum

* Thickness penetrated per round of X-raying

It's possible to scan an area of up to 100 square feet in 1 round. For example, during 1 round you could scan a stone wall 10 feet wide and 10 feet high. Alternatively, you could scan an area 5 feet wide and 20 feet high. You are 90 percent likely to locate secret compartments, drawers, recesses, and doors using X-ray vision scanning.

Note: This spell can replace true seeing as the prerequisite for the ring of X-ray vision.
