### 📜 Description
A white ray of light springs from your hand; you direct it at your opponents by making a ranged touch attack. If you hit, it deals 1d6 points of fire damage per level (maximum 20d6), and permanently blinds the target. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces the damage by half and reduces the blinding effect to the Dazzled condition for 24 hours. Undead and creatures vulnerable or sensitive to light take 1d8 points of damage per level (maximum 20d8). Constructs take only 1d4 points of damage per level (maximum 20d4). Creatures that are immune to blinding effects cannot be blinded or dazzled by this spell, but can still take damage. Creatures that are immune or resistant to fire effects cannot be damaged by this spell, but can still be blinded or dazzled.
