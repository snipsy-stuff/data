### üìú Description
When you use this power, you tap into massive amounts of arcane energy that you can use to fuel future spells you cast, but you lose a great amount of mobility. Upon casting this spell you radiate a bright multi-colored light. You provide bright illumination in a 40-foot radius, and shadowy illumination for an additional 40 feet. Your feet lift off the ground and you hover six inches in the air. For the duration of this spell, as the spell is not dismissible, you cannot move from your spot, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC, but you gain a +8 bonus to CMD, and it requires a successful Strength check (DC 20+ your primary caster ability modifier) for another creature to move you from that spot. 

You also benefit tremendously from the spell. You gain a +8 inherent bonus to your primary casting ability score (Intelligence for wizards or Charisma for sorcerers) and a +5 bonus to your caster level. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your (modified) caster level.
