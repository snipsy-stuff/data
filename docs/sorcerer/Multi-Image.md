### 📜 Description
Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. As a move action, the figments can all be directed to act independently and disappear when struck.

This spell creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you though they must remain within 10 feet/caster level of you. You can move into and through an image. When you and an image separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which one is the image. The figments may also move through each other. If not directed by you, the figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on. 

Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball). 

While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded. An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)
