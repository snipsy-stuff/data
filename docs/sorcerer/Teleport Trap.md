### üìú Description
Teleport trap wards an area (one 40-ft. cube/level, shapeable), redirecting all teleportation into or out of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you at the time of casting. The destination must be an open space, though it does not need to have a solid surface for the target to stand upon. The spell's area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or similar means).

At your discretion, the teleport trap can exclude a category of creatures, such as an alignment, a type of creature, or creatures carrying a specific item or knowing a password (though this only works if the creature is teleporting out of the area, not into it). You select this option and the conditions at the time you cast the spell. Overly complicated conditions may cause the spell to fail entirely. Multiple castings of teleport trap can be linked to cover a larger area, allowing teleported creatures to be directed to a single point within the combined area of the spells.

Teleport trap can be made permanent at the cost of 7,000 gp. A single permanency spell can be used on all teleport traps in a link, but the gold piece cost must be paid for each individual spell.

The Pathfinders of the Grand Lodge make use of permanent teleport traps in several key locations, trapping would-be intruders in a small wing of jail cells. At least one crypt of the Whispering Tyrant makes use of the spell as well, trapping grave robbers in coffin-sized stone cysts, there to die a slow and agonizing death from thirst and starvation.
