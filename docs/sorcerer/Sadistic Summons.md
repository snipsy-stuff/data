### 📜 Description
You summon a fiendish dire weasel as if using a summon monster spell. The difference is, the monster appears on top of a creature within range (caster's choice), with its teeth already sunk into the creature as if it had made a successful bite attack. The caster need only make a successful ranged touch attack against the creature; this special attack has a threat range of 17-20 (this thread range cannot be augmented or changed), if a critical hit is confirmed the weasel deals critical damage each round it is attached. The weasel then uses its attach and blood drain powers on that round and each subsequent round. This fiendish dire weasel also has maximum hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to damage. If the fiendish dire weasel kills the target or becomes unattached, it attacks as it would under the effects of a normal summon monster spell. Unlike other summoned monsters, even if the caster speaks the creature's language, it cannot receive commands other than to attack.
