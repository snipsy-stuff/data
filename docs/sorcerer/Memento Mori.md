### 📜 Description
You transform yourself into a horrifying vision of death, crawling with maggots and rotting away, exuding the stench of the grave. All creatures that see you are entitled to a Will save; those that fail lose their next standard action (or lose all actions next round if they roll a saving throw of 1).

Those that roll a successful saving throw are immune to further castings of this spell for 24 hours
