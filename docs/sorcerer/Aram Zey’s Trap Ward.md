### 📜 Description
While he was researching the underlying causes of the resonance created by overlapping abjurations, Aram Zey discovered a way to manipulate that resonance to the caster’s advantage when encountering magical traps. The protection provided by Aram Zey’s trap ward comes into play whenever the caster is subjected to the effects of a magical trap. The spell immediately discharges and interferes with the trap’s function in an attempt to counter the trap’s magic. When this occurs, make a caster level check as an immediate action. The DC of this check is equal to the trap’s Disable Device DC. If you’re successful, the trap ward dispels the magical effect of the trap before the effect actually manifests, effectively preventing the trap from triggering for the next 1d4 rounds and ending Aram Zey’s trap ward immediately.
