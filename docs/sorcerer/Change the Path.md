### 📜 Description
Change the Path can completely twist a path around, causing it to bend around itself, shifting boulders, buildings, trees, sewers, statues, walls, and underground tunnels to fit its new path, with hardly noticeable effects by the locals. To use this spell, you must stand on the path that you wish to adjust, and must be of a sufficient level to alter the entire length of the path (subject to DM adjudication). If you meet these prerequisites, you can do one or more of the following:

• Make the path longer or shorter, but no more than twice, or less than half, its original length.

• Make as many twists and turns as you like within the resulting length.

• Make the path wider or narrower, but no more than twice, or less than half, its original width.

• Change one end of the path such that it intersects with another street or dead ends elsewhere within the spell's range.

Shifting and warping reality around its new path, the path affected by change the path moves structures and creatures out of its way harmlessly, pushing objects apart or pulling them together, narrowing and widening the new street to suit the result that the spellcaster designates. The spell cannot alter any other objects other than the path itself, and cannot affect magical structures.
