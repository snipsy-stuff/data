### 📜 Description
A cloud of ink billows outward from you. The ink obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 ft. Creatures within 5 ft. of you have concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment. A moderate gust of wind or, if underwater, a moderate current (11 mph or more for each) disperses the ink in 4 rounds; a strong wind or current (21 mph or more) disperses the ink in 1 round.

This spell only functions underwater or in other liquid.
