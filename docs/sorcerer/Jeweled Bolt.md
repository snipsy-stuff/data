### 📜 Description
On a successful ranged touch attack, you conjure up a large, jagged, prismatic crystal that bursts from the ground and flies toward a flying target.

The crystal shatters into smaller jewels that cover the target creature and deal 1d4 hp damage per 2 levels. The target must make a Fortitude save or immediately begin falling. If the save is successful, the target descends to the ground at a rate of 60 ft. per round and takes no damage upon landing. A failed save means an uncontrolled fall.

An affected creature cannot fly until the jewels are removed, a process which takes 10 minutes for Medium-size creatures, 20 minutes for Large, 30 minutes for Huge, and so on. The jewels themselves always crumble into worthless powder when removed.
