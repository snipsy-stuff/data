### 📜 Description
You imbue the target with the death throes supernatural ability. When the target is slain, its body combusts in a flash of white-hot flame. This acts like a fireball that deals 3d6 hp fire damage to all creatures within a 20-ft.-radius burst. A Reflex save halves this damage; the save's DC is equal to the DC for this spell. The target's gear or any treasure it carries are unaffected by this explosion.

Final combustion is a curse effect, and, as such, spells that remove a curse also remove this spell's effects.
