### üìú Description
You transport yourself and an area chosen by you (and everything in that area) to another location that you have physically visited. The destination must be somehow befitting of the locale moved. Thus, if a dragon's lair is a system of caves built into a cliff side, you can shift the lair to another set of cliffs nearby, on another continent, or on another plane. The spell then creates the space needed for the shift (magically and instantly digging out new caves in the new cliff wall that conform to the original caves) and fills in the space left behind (the old caves at the original location are filled in with natural stone). The lair conforms as well as possible to the new site. Conforming may include shifting the layout, size, and entrance of a location slightly (subject to GM adjudication). 

If it fit within the spell's area, a whole building could be transported to a new location. You could also move only a few rooms, making them into their own separate structure at the destination or attaching them onto an existing structure. They could even replace rooms in an extant structure. 

You transport the environment as well, so when shifting a castle underwater, the castle does not fill with water; if you transport it into the heart of a volcano, the interior of the castle retains its normal temperature. As the duration is instantaneous, these effects remain (e.g. a castle room teleported into the heart of a volcano remains comfortable).
