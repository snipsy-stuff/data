### üìú Description
This spell conjures a wall of heaped corpses. This wall must be created on a suitable, stable surface and cannot share space with any creature or object, excepting other corpses. Any corpses in the area do not form a true part of the corpsewall spell and remain after the spell ends. The wall is 6 ft. high and can be climbed by those who don't find the whole idea disturbing.

The wall is buoyant and can be summoned on top of a body of water, remaining in place even on a strong current. If conjured under water, it floats to the surface within 1 round. The wall is held together magically and does not disperse into individual corpses when damaged.

The corpsewall can be animated with an animate dead spell or a similar effect. Unlike a standard animate dead spell, this requires no material component. An animated corpsewall will lash out at anyone within 5 ft., making an attack using the caster's base attack bonus plus Intelligence modifier.

On a successful hit, the attack deals 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier hp damage and starts a grapple using its attack bonus as its CMB. Grappled targets can attempt a Reflex save to escape each round. On your turn, any grappled targets take an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.
