### 📜 Description
Beast's curse makes its target the victim of constant harassment by animals. Whenever an animal passes within either 30 feet of the victim or scent range, that animal's attitude immediately shifts to hostile. Animals are liable to attack or harass the character: birds fly around and peck at the character, cats trip him, and larger animals might do worse.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. It can also be removed with a successful Wild Empathy check (DC 15 + your caster level).
