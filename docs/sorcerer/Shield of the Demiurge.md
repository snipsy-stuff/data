### 📜 Description
You wrap yourself in a shimmering shield at the cost of being able to cast other spells. While in effect, shield of the demiurge provides a + 10 deflection bonus to Armor Class as well as spell resistance 11 plus caster level. However, during this time you cannot cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or use spell completion or spell trigger magical items. The shield's power simply absorbs and negates any such attempts (spells cast or charges used while the shield remains active are lost as if used).
