### 📜 Description
With a word and a gesture, you send a wave of bright light and a thunderous explosion directly into your target's mind, overwhelming their senses and dealing them profound pain without harming their body directly. This wave of pain deals 1d6 hp nonlethal damage per two levels and leaves the target stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save negates the stun and reduces the damage by half.
