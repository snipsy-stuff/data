### 📜 Description
When this spell is cast, 10 dimly glowing gems or crystals of any color the caster wishes float around the target's body protecting the target from spells, spell-like abilities, and spell-like effects from devices. Any spell of 4th level or lower can be absorbed by lesser crystalguard, if the target of lesser crystalguard wishes, and the same number of crystals equal to the spell level glow brightly and disappear. Only the effects of the spells that are cast that would affect the target of lesser crystalguard  can be absorbed. The recipient of lesser crystalguard must have enough gems remaining around his body to absorb a spell, otherwise lesser crystalguard has no protective effect against that spell.
