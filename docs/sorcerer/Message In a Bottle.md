### 📜 Description
You whisper a message into the mouth of a drinking vessel. The size of the vessel dictates the maximum length of the message; a potion vial holds 30 words, an acid flask holds 60, and a wine bottle holds 150. The vessel is not considered enchanted, though its contents are and the whole thing gives off a faint transmutation aura.

After speaking the message, you must seal the container. As soon as the vessel is uncorked, the message is audibly recited to all those within hearing distance. Subsequent openings have no effect. You hear the first 30 words of the first response spoken to your message, so long as you are on the same plane as the speaker.

Multiple messages may be imparted via the same vessel as long as they fit. An unopened vessel holds its message as long as the vessel remains otherwise inviolate. If the vessel is broken, torn or otherwise rendered useless as a container, the magic and the message are lost.
