### 📜 Description
You shoot forth a flaming, night-black ray that strikes with an appalling and shadowy chill. A night-black flame begins to burn on the victim's body. If the victim fails a Fortitude save, it suffers 4 points Constitution drain. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 4 rounds (5 rounds total) to avoid being drained of an additional 4 points of Constitution per round. The caster gains 10 temporary hit points whenever it drains 4 points of Constitution. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the victim is slain by blightfire ray, only icy fragments of the victim remain.
