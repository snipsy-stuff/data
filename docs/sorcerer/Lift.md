### 📜 Description
Lift allows you to levitate unwilling creatures or unattended objects. You cannot control the target's movement; they simply hang in the air, moving upward at 5 ft. per round until they reach an obstacle or the spell wears off. When the spell ends, affected subjects will fall to the ground unless otherwise stopped.

Creatures that reach a barrier (such as a ceiling) may pull themselves along it at half their normal movement (doing so requires a DC 15 Acrobatics check to move greater than 1/2 their normal movement unless they have a climbing move speed). Subjects may be moved by strong winds, ropes, telekinesis, or through other means at the GM's discretion. Targets of this spell are denied their Dexterity bonus to their AC.

A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A Reflex save made to stabilize allows the creature to begin again at -1.
