### 📜 Description
This spell functions as unhallowed blows, except the enhancement bonus is +1 per 4 caster levels (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can imbue all of a creature’s natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).

Greater unhallowed blows can be made permanent with a permanency spell. In this case, the caster must be at least 11th level and must expend 7,500 gp worth of diamond dust as a material component.
