### 📜 Description
You douse one small source of natural light, such as a candle, lantern, or torch. A caster of 2nd level or higher can extinguish multiple fires at the same time, as long as they are all within the spell's area. Larger fires such as hearth fires, campfires, bonfires, and magical fires are unaffected.
