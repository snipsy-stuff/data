### 📜 Description
Enforced choke causes force energy to grip the throat of one or more victims. Each victim immediately begins to suffocate. After failing the initial save, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution check in order to continue holding her breath. The save must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.

When a target fails one of these Constitution checks, she suffocates and makes no further checks. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hit points). In the following round, she drops to - 1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, she dies.
