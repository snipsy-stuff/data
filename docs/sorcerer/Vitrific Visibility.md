### 📜 Description
You coat any invisible creatures within the area with a glassy layer of crystalline facets that adheres and melds onto the target’s skin and clothing or armor. This effect outlines the target as glitterdust for 1 round per level. In addition, living creatures are temporarily petrified for the same duration on a failed Fortitude save, turned into statues of solid glass. A vitrified creature retains its normal hit points but has hardness 0 while petrified. Break enchantment, dispel magic, and stone to flesh all return a vitrified creature to normal. This spell has no effect on visible creatures, though it affects invisible creatures outlined by dust of appearance, faerie fire, glitterdust, or similar effects.
