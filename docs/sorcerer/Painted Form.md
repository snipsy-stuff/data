### üìú Description
The subject, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried, becomes an immobile, two-dimensional painting on a flat surface within 30 ft. of the subject (the caster chooses the specific location). This painted representation can take one of two forms.

The first form lasts for 1 minute/level and subject can see and hear normally, though limited by its position (for example, the subject cannot lean to look around a corner). The subject does not need to breathe but can speak and cast spells normally. The subject's painted form is animate enough to perform somatic gestures and retrieve spell components from its person but not enough to move from its location. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect its painted surface. While in painted form, the subject gains hardness equivalent to that of the surface beneath it (5 for a wooden surface, 8 for stone, 15 for iron or steel) and retains its own hp. The subject cannot be affected by spells that target a specific creature, save for touch spells. While in painted form, the subject also is not considered living for the purposes of spells cast against it. Area spells affect the subject normally, though the subject's limited animation suffers a -10 penalty on Reflex saving throws. If reduced to zero hp, the subject retakes its original form, is prone, and is disabled

The second form of this spell transforms a willing subject into a painted representation that is completely immobile and inanimate. The subject in this form does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, and it retains a hazy awareness of its surroundings but can take no actions. Time seems to pass quickly and dreamily for a subject in this form, as if dropped into a pleasant slumber.

The caster selects a condition upon casting this spell which will trigger the painted representation and return it to its regular form; these conditions must meet the same parameters as the conditions for a symbol of death spell. The painted form remains in its inert state until the triggering conditions are met or until the effect is ended through a dispel magic, break enchantment, freedom or similar effect.
