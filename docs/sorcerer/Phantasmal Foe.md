### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of an enemy of the subject simply by forming the thoughts of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this enemy. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal foe. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject and the subject must succeed on a second Will save or is afflicted with the cowering condition from fear. Even if the Will save is successful, the subject is subject to the shaken condition for one round.

If the subject of phantasmal foe succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the foe can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
