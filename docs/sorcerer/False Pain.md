### 📜 Description
The spell creates the sensation of an excruciating headache, internal distress, burning skin, or the like. Anyone failing a Will save takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round (maximum 10 rounds). Furthermore, the target also suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks and ability checks. The target can attempt to disbelieve as a standard action and is entitled to a new Will save. If the target succeeds on the save, the spell ends but the nonlethal damage remains until cured or healed naturally.
