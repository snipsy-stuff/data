### üìú Description
You instantly hop from your current location to any other spot within range. If the spot you choose is within your line of sight, you arrive there unerringly and can take a move action if you have one available to you. If your destination is not in line of sight, you must be able to visualize the spot or state the direction and distance to it, but your hop has a 25% chance of a mishap and you cannot take any further actions until your next turn. No matter what your destination, you can transport only yourself and a maximum 100 lb. (or your maximum load, whichever is less) of objects you carry or touch. You cannot transport any creature except for your familiar or an animal companion or cohort of up to Tiny size (whose weight counts against your load limit). 

If you suffer a mishap or arrive in a place already occupied by a solid body, you and any creatures with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and are shunted to the Astral Plane.
