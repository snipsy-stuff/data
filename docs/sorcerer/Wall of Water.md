### üìú Description
You create an opaque, upward wall of water that blocks vision. Creatures trying to pass through the wall take 2d6 hp bludgeoning damage +1/level (maximum +20) and must make a Reflex save or be pushed back 5 ft. The wall deals double damage to creatures with the fire subtype.

If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each takes damage as if trying to pass through the wall (half damage on a successful Reflex save). Each is pushed into a square of the creature's choice adjacent to the area occupied by the wall. If any 5-ft. length of wall takes 20 hp or more of magical fire damage in 1 round, that length evaporates.

Wall of water can be made permanent with a permanency spell. This costs 5,000 gp with minimum level 10th. A permanent wall of water suppressed with fire becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.
