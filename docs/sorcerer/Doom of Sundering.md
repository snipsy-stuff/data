### 📜 Description
Your weapon glows with otherworldly flames. The damage you inflict on your foe is also applied as object damage to your opponent's weapon hp; with each strike, they see their wooden or iron weapon slowly crumbling into sawdust or rust, driving some foes to panic or despair. Magic weapons are immune to this spell. Weapon hardness still applies.
