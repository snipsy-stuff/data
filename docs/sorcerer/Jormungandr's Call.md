### 📜 Description
Jormungandr's call summons one coil of the titanic snake that surrounds the world from deep within the sea or from the earth below. Even this hint of Jormungandr's power is enough to create mass chaos and destruction.

Due to the tremors when Jormungandr's body breaches the surface, all terrain becomes difficult for the duration of the spell and any structure takes 8d6 hp damage.

The world serpent's sudden and violent appearance throws around flying debris on land and vaporizes water at sea; either deals 8d6 hp damage to any creatures it strikes (Reflex DC 15 half).

All creatures within the spell's range are frightened. Creatures that carry a scale of Jormungandr may make a Will save: if the save succeeds, the creature is merely shaken by Jormungandr's presence.
