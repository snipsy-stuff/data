### 📜 Description
You call forth a writhing, inky glyph of dark force for every four caster levels you possess. These slithering inscriptions orbit your person to intercept hostile magics. Each glyph counters a single spell, treated as a targeted dispel magic at your caster level. Scribing the glyphs requires inks made with aboleth ichor and powdered stone ioun essence.

No more than one glyph can trigger in a single round, and a glyph is expended regardless of the results of the dispel check. At 14th level, the glyphs are treated as greater dispel magic for the purposes of countering spells.
