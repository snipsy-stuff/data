### üìú Description
When you cast construct form, you turn your body into a non-living, magically-powered construct. Your soul is stored is a special gem that controls the body. You may choose to appear either as a lifelike double of your original self or as an obviously mechanical being, which has the same general size and shape as your true appearance. You retain your hit points (minus those granted by your Constitution modifier), base attack bonus, saving throws, class features, and most other special abilities. You also retain all of your ability scores with the exception of +10 size bonus to Strength and loss of your Constitution, for which you have no score for the duration of the spell. You gain a +8 natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 ft., DR 10/adamantine and you gain one slam attack (2d8 plus Strength), your type changes to construct and you gain all construct traits (see Pathfinder Bestiary) except that you are not destroyed if reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. Instead, you immediately return to your normal form, retaining the same hit point total.

You can choose to take a golem form gaining the magic immunity (based on the golem you have a piece of). If you do, your appearance reflects this chosen form (your body becomes decayed patchwork flesh if you have become a flesh golem, for example). However, you lose all spell and spell-like abilities you possess while you maintain this form.
