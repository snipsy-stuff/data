### 📜 Description
A large, dark cloud appears and releases a heavy rain on all creatures within a 20-foot radius. Creatures within the area are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful save results in subjects being confused (as the spell confusion) for 1 round and are immune to the confusion caused by castings of this spell for 24 hours. Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, those within the deluge suffer a -10 on Perception checks. The deluge obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
