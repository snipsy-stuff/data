### 📜 Description
This spell increases gravity tenfold, and all creatures in the area other than you drop all held objects and fall prone and helpless. If some solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when flying or levitating creatures fall, objects and take triple normal falling damage.

Any affected standing creature must make a DC 20 Strength check each round or fall prone. Once prone, creatures remain crushed by their own weight and suffer 3d12 hp bludgeoning damage each round until they make a successful DC 25 Strength or Dexterity check, at which point they stop taking damage but must continue making Strength checks to stand and stay upright. Failing another Strength check means the creature falls prone again and again begins taking damage as before.

All ranged attacks fall to the ground and miss in the area of the spell. This includes ranged touch attacks, thrown weapons, arrows, bolts, magical flaming spheres, and so on. The only exceptions are bolts of force.

Affected creatures may take free or swift actions but may not move or take standard actions. Creatures under the influence of a freedom of movement spell gain a +8 circumstance bonus to all Strength or Dexterity checks required by this spell. At the end of the spell's duration, affected creatures must make a Fortitude save or be exhausted. Creatures that save successfully are fatigued.
