### 📜 Description
You sense the direction and distance of a body of water such as a lake, stream, or ocean, even if it is underground or beyond your sight. This spell cannot be used to sense the presence of water in a creature's body or small amounts of water such as that contained in a flask, cup or barrel. This spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead, but it will pierce illusions.
