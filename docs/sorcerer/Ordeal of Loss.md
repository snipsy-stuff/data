### 📜 Description
Ordeal of loss has no effect until a charm spell discharges on the target creature or until the caster wills it so (free action). The target creature becomes filled with terrible regret and depression. These dark feelings can overwhelm the subject; if it fails a Will save, it suffers 10 points of subdual damage per caster level (to a maximum of 200). This damage can carry over, becoming lethal damage. Only one ordeal of loss per level can affect any creature at any one time, a second casting negates the first. This spell is often cast upon creatures that are charmed by the caster (and hence are considered willing when the spell is cast, granting no saving throw against the effect).
