### 📜 Description
By casting zone of mishaps, you manipulate magical energy in your immediate vicinity so that spells that are cast within the area are affected by a mishap. This effect is centered on you and moves with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. 

Each time a spell is affected by this spell, its caster must succeed on a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level) or suffer a spell mishap, as per the rules for Scroll Mishaps (See Pathfinder Roleplaying Game).
