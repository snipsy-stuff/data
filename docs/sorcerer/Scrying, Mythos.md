### 📜 Description
This spell functions as scrying, but while using this spell the caster is aware that others within the realm of meta-real consciousness are also watching him and the one he watches. Every minute or fraction thereof spent scrying, the caster must make a DC 15 Will save; the DC increases by 1 every minute. If any Will save is failed, the caster is subject to a nightmare spell the next time he goes to sleep.
