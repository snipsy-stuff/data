### 📜 Description
A black globe of negative energy rolls in whichever direction you point and affects those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and inflicts a negative level upon that creature, though a successful Fortitude save negates that damage. The caster gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level the spell inflicts; they remain for 1 hour. A necromantic sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. 

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest. It can be negated by any conjuration (healing) spell of 5th level or higher. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its negative level. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A necromantic sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
