### 📜 Description
With an outstretched arm that passes into an alternate dimension and a successful incorporeal ranged touch attack (although you do not become incorporeal), you reach into a target creature and slash one of its arteries. This attack ignores the target's cover bonuses, shield, natural armor, and most armor, but it does not ignore armor bonuses granted by force effects such as mage armor and bracers of armor.

The attack deals 1d6 hp damage per caster level (maximum 15d6 hp damage). If the target makes a successful save, it takes half damage. Otherwise, the target begins bleeding freely into hyperdimensional space, suffering 1 hp bleed damage per round until mage armor, bracers of armor, or another full-body force effect blocks the hemorrhaging.

A successful DC 24 Knowledge (arcana) check reveals these possible remedies. When 1 hp bleed damage would kill the victim, it receives a final saving throw to prevent further blood loss. This spell has no effect on bloodless creatures.
