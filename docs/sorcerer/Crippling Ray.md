### 📜 Description
A dark purple ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to its highest ability score (Str, Dex, or Con) equal to your caster level. The subject's ability score cannot drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.

Remove curse does not remove the effects of crippling ray. Greater restoration, miracle, regeneration, or wish can restore the creature.
