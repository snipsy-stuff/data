### 📜 Description
An invisible bank of acidic and toxic gases billows out from the point you designate. Those exposed to the cloud suffer severe and painful blisters all over their bodies and inside their lungs, suffering wracking pains that impose a -4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. In addition, the subject is nauseated and suffers 1d6 bleed damage each round. These effects last for 1 hour. A successful saving throw reduces the nauseated condition to sickened, reduces the bleed damage by half, and reduces the circumstance penalty to -2. Constructs, undead, and creatures immune to both poison and acid are immune to this spell. Creatures immune to only one of these effects, or resistant to both, receive only a +4 bonus to their saving throw.

The wracking pains and conditions inflicted this spell can only be negated by a 6th level or higher conjuration (healing) spell.

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gases in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gases in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.
