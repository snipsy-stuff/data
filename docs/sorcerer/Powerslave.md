### 📜 Description
This spell functions as lesser powerslave, but with the effect of geas/quest rather than lesser geas upon the target. In addition, the profane bonus you provide to the enslaved creature is doubed, as is their penalty to saving throws against your mind-affecting spells and their Madness gained.
