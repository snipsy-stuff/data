### 📜 Description
This spell summons either a lammasu or shedu (your choice, see Bestiary 3) to aid you, by virtue of a celestial compact that binds the creature to aid devout servants of good. The creature appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It will use its skills and abilities to aid you as you command to the best of its ability. Any attempt to get the creature to commit an evil act immediately ends the summoning.
