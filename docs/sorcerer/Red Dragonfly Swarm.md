### 📜 Description
This spell summons a swarm of red dragonflies with a fly speed of 30 ft. per round. You can command the swarm for as long as you concentrate, and the spell deals 1d6 hp damage plus 1d6 hp fire damage for every 4 levels the spellcaster possesses. Treat this damage as magical for the purposes of penetrating damage resistance. Otherwise treat as a standard summon swarm spell, and the swarm follows the rules for the swarm subtype in the Pathfinder Bestiary.
