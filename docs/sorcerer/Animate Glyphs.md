### üìú Description
You may trace a number of glyphs equal to your caster level, each corresponding in size to a Small object. As you increase in levels, you may inscribe larger glyphs as follows: a Medium glyph counts as two Small glyphs, a Large glyph as four, and a Huge glyph as eight.

Once the glyph or glyphs are complete, they remain immaterial and adjacent to you, floating silently until activated as a move action. When so activated, they spring to life as animated objects (see Pathfinder Bestiary) appropriate to the size of the glyph or glyphs traced. These animated glyphs remain for 1 round/level or until destroyed.

Glyphs created by this spell have hp equal to half that of an animated object of their size category, and the animated glyphs have a touch attack that deals acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic damage (your choice at time of casting). The damage depends on the size of glyph; Small glyphs deal 2d8 damage, and each successively larger glyph deals 1d8 more damage. Spell resistance applies to this damage.
