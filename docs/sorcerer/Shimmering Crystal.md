### 📜 Description
The target creature of this spell believes he is transported to a place that holds whatever he wishes for most. He also forgets where he was last, what he was doing, and only thinks of the fact that what he wants most is now near. He hasn't, of course, been transported anywhere - all of this happens in the target's mind. The target is actually stunned for the duration of the spell. In any round that the target takes damage while under the influence of shimmering crystal, he receives another saving throw against shimmering crystal.
