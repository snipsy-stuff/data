### 📜 Description
This spell functions similarly to illusory script, but rather than implanting a suggestion in a creature reading the script, the caster can instead implant one of the following effects: bestow curse, modify memory, nightmare, reckless infatuation, or unadulterated loathing. The caster must specify the object of the reader’s infatuation or loathing for latter two effects; in addition, the caster can stipulate that the book itself becomes the target of their infatuation or loathing, rather than a creature as normally required for those spells. Regardless of the effect placed in the inscrutable grimoire, a creature failing a saving throw against its effects gains 1 Madness point.
