### üìú Description
You create a temporary duplicate of yourself and your gear (excluding artifacts). This is not a clone - you control the duplicate as surely as you control yourself, for you and it are one person: one mind with two bodies. Both you and the duplicate can do anything that you can do, independently. For example, if you are an 18th level sorcerer, so is the duplicate - you can both cast spells, communicate with your familiar, walk across the room, use items, and so on. In any given round of the duration, you can both take independent actions, so the duplicate can cast a spell and you can use a wand. You and the duplicate do not need to stay close to each other. If you create a duplicate, you can have it step through a magic gate to explore what lies beyond, while the "real you" stays safe on this side. You share the same thoughts - your thoughts are the duplicate's. 

The duplicate is an exact replica of you as you are at the moment you cast the spell though it cannot act until the round after you cast the spell. If you are down 11 hit points and 1 point of Constitution, so is the duplicate. If you are diseased, so is the duplicate. The duplicate does not carry lingering spell effects (neither beneficial ones, such as cat's grace or stoneskin, nor harmful ones, such as slow or doom), even if you do when you cast the spell. After the duplicate is created, you can cast spell effects on it (or the duplicate can cast them), but even then, spell effects are not necessarily shared by both of you. The duplicate cannot be commanded to hurt you any more easily than you can be commanded to harm yourself. Spells cast by either the duplicate or you come from your spell total. For example, if you are a wizard and have one lightning bolt spell prepared, when the duplicate casts the spell, it is no longer available to you. Charged items (or items or abilities with a number of available uses per day) that you or the duplicate use count against the total number of daily charges or uses.

If the duplicate dies, the spell duration ends. If you die, the duplicate becomes the permanent version of you, its gear becomes the "real gear" and your gear disappears. You suffer a permanent negative level as you transition your soul into the new form as if you had been the subject of a resurrection spell. The duplicate is now you (and can cast duplicate again). 

You cannot have more than one duplicate at a time (and a duplicate cannot have a duplicate). This spell cannot be made permanent, other than by the death of the caster, as mentioned above.
