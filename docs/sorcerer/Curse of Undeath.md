### 📜 Description
This spell places a curse upon the subject, causing that creature to rise again as an undead creature after death. The subject is unharmed so long as it lives. Should the subject die while under the effect of this spell, attempts at reviving the creature through spells such as raise dead and resurrection fail. In 1d4 rounds, the creature instead rises as an undead, as detailed below. The type of undead creature is determined by the GM, but it should include an undead template appropriate for the creature.

Created undead are not under the control of the spell's caster. Undead created by this spell are created instantaneously, and thus continue to exist even if the spell that created them is dispelled or dismissed. A remove curse spell can remove this effect, but it must be cast before the creature rises into unlife.
