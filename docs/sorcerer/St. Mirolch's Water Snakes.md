### 📜 Description
You create and/or control surface currents within 1 mile of your position, allowing you to speed your vessel or steer enemy ships toward shoals and rocks. You can confound experienced navigators and make entering a narrow inlet a harrowing, backbreaking gamble.

You may devise as complex a system of slow or fast moving surface currents as desired. Each current carries floating creatures, flotsam, and vessels at a speed of up to 60 ft. in the horizontal direction of your choice. The currents persist until the spell ends, you move beyond the area of effect, or you choose to alter them by concentrating.
