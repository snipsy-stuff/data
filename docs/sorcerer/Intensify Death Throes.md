### 📜 Description
The target of this spell must have the death throes abilities. This spell greatly increases the impact of the recipient's death throes.

If the spell's target dies within the spell's duration, its death throes ability deals double the normal damage (or inflicts an additional 2d6 hp fire damage if the death throes normally deals no damage), increases the range by 10 ft., and adds +2 to the DC for any saves associated with the death throes.

Additionally, the death throes utterly destroy the target's body and any gear it carries (magic items receive a Reflex saving throw to avoid destruction, with a DC equal to this spell's DC.

You can set this spell to trigger death throes when the target becomes unconscious or unable to move, but you must decide on the conditions when casting the spell.
