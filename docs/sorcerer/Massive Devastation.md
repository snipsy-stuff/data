### 📜 Description
You blast the area with acid, electricity, fire and sonic energy. The area fills with roaring flames, horrific corrosives, thundering sounds, and massive charges. The spell inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level (20d6 maximum), one quarter of the damage is dealt by each of the preceding types, allowing to at least partial bypass most forms of immunity and resistance. Further, it creates a number of secondary effects:

Acid: Affected creatures' clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid (half their hp total maximum) potentially inflicting the broken condition (or ruining the item if it has already sustained damage).

Electricity: Affected creatures are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds.

Fire: Flammable objects in the area catch fire, including flammable characters.

Sonic: The sound pressure waves inflict the deafened and knocked prone conditions on all creatures, regardless of size.

A successful save results in half damage and negates all the secondary effects.
