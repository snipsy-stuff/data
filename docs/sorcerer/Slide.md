### 📜 Description
The subject glides swiftly over the ground, so swiftly that he or she may fall prone to make a double move as a single move action. On a steep slope, this may become a triple move as a single movement action but the sliding creature takes 1d6 hp bludgeoning damage from the sudden stop at the end.

In either case, the prone creature provokes attacks of opportunity during this movement and grants foes a +1 damage bonus to attacks of opportunity that hit.
