### 📜 Description
On a successful melee touch attack, the caster's touch deals 1d6 hp/4 levels (maximum 5d6 at 20th level) in ability score damage. You choose the ability when this spell is cast.

An ability score cannot be reduced to zero or below using this spell; if this spell would cause enough damage to do so, that score is instead reduced to 1 and another ability or abilities must be assigned the remaining damage.
