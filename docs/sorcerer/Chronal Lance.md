### 📜 Description
You compel temporal energy to coalesce into one or more glowing lances of pure force that hover next to you. With a gesture, you send them streaking towards their targets. You create one lance plus one additional lance every 3 caster levels past first (maximum 4).

For each lance, make a ranged touch attack against a target creature. If hit, the target creature is staggered for 1 round/level. You can target a single creature with more than one lance and make an attack roll for each lance used in this manner, but multiple successful attacks do not cause any additional effects to occur, and the duration of the stagger effect does not stack. As force effects, the lances can affect incorporeal and ethereal creatures.
