### 📜 Description
A gleaming pearl-sized silver sphere appears in your palm, glowing as brightly as a candle. You can use the pearl to make a melee touch attack or throw it as a splash weapon, making a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 60 feet. If the sphere is wielded by any other creature, treat it as an improvised melee weapon (-4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls) or as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.

When the pearl hits (either as a ranged or melee attack), it breaks and releases a flash of intense light. The target struck takes 1d6 points of damage plus one point per caster level (maximum +5). Creatures in the splash area (including the target struck and the wielder, if not you) must make a Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1d4 rounds. Undead creatures struck take 2d6 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10) and must save or be blinded for 2d4 rounds. Undead creatures in the splash area take 1d6 points of damage plus one point per caster level (maximum +5) and must save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.

The flash from the breaking pearl of brilliance counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level. A darkness spell of equal or higher level counters or dispels pearl of brilliance.
