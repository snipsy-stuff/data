### 📜 Description
The target has her link with her bonded creature temporarily severed. If the subject has a familiar, she loses the benefits of the alertness, deliver touch spells, empathic link, scry on familiar, share spells, and speak with master abilities. If the target has an animal companion, she loses the benefits of the link, share spells, and devotion abilities. The target and her familiar or animal companion also lose any other abilities (such as those from archetypes or feats) that rely on the two having a connection.
