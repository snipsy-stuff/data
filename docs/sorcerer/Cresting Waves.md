### 📜 Description
This spell creates waves of water (which move at approximately 50 mph) that originate from you, affecting all creatures in their path. All creatures in this area (10 ft. wide by 10 ft. high) that are Large or smaller must make a DC 20 Swim check or be blown back 2d6 x 10 feet, knocked prone, and take 1d6 points of damage per ten feet moved. Large or smaller creatures must make a DC 25 Swim skill check to move against the force of the waves.

Huge or larger creatures may move normally within the cresting waves effect.

This spell can move a creature beyond the limit of its range. In the area of the cresting waves, all non-seige ranged attacks are negated, all Perception checks fail, and it automatically extinguishes all flames (wall of fire, torch, lanterns etc.).

In addition to the effects noted, a cresting waves can do anything that a string of 10-foot waves would be expected to do. It can overturn wooded, unsecured buoyant structures, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.
