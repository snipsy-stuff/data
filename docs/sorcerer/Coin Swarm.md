### 📜 Description
This devastating spell turns any pile of 1,000 coins or more into a swarm of flying shards of metal with a fly speed of 30 ft. per round. The swarm is under the mental command of the caster as long as he or she concentrates, and it deals 1d6 hp damage for every 4 caster levels of the spellcaster. The damage is treated as magical for the purposes of penetrating damage resistance.

If the pile contains any coins of unusual metals, such as cold iron, mithral, or adamantium, the swarm can penetrate the relevant damage resistance. Otherwise treat as a standard summon swarm spell, and the swarm follows the rules for the swarm subtype in the Pathfinder Bestiary.
