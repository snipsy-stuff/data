### üìú Description
When you cast this spell, you superheat the target object to its melting point, effectively ruining it. Even if the object succeeds on its saving throw it is reduced to half its hit point total and gains the broken condition, though it does become immune to any further effects of this spell for 24 hours. If the object melts while in someone's possession, the wielder risks taking damage. Molten metal deals 2d6 points of fire damage for each round of exposure. Even after a creature is no longer in contact with the metal, it takes 1d6 points of fire damage for 1d3 rounds. If the object is simply held in the hands, such as a weapon, the wielder may make a Reflex save. If successful, he drops the object quickly enough to negate taking any damage. Even if he fails his initial save, the wielder of a handheld item can clear his hand of molten metal as a move action. If molten destroys a subject's armor, the molten metal is harder to avoid. The subject is not entitled to a Reflex save, and removing the molten metal requires two full round actions (not necessarily consecutively). Alternately, if another creature assists a creature in molten armor, together they can clear it by each taking a full round action, but in that case the assisting creature also takes damage from exposure as described above.

At the end of the spell's duration, the affected objects instantly cool, reforming in whatever is their current shape (likely a puddle on the ground). 

Molten can also be used to damage most creatures made of metal (for example some constructs and elementals). In this case, the duration of the spell is instantaneous. Molten deals 1d8 points of fire damage per level (maximum 10d8) when used in this way.
