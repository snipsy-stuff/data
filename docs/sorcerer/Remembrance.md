### 📜 Description
This spell allows you to instantly recall something specific from your past that you want to remember (such as the precise route taken through a maze of corridors, the contents of a scroll read long ago, the face of someone you met only fleetingly, or the activation words for a magic item). Remembrance comes to you with vivid clarity, as if you've just experienced it for the first time, and you will be able to examine it repeatedly without fading or distortion until the next time you sleep. This spell can only restore memory of an event or piece of information the caster once knew; it can't be used to reveal something you never experienced. If the memory you are seeking has been magically suppressed, remembrance grants an immediate Will save, with a +5 bonus, to negate the suppressing magic.
