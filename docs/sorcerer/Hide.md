### 📜 Description
Any one object you touch becomes effectively hidden and invisible; the DC on Perception checks to see the object hidden on a person increases by 20. Objects not held are effectively invisible.

Hidden objects do not lose their weight, glow, smell, sound, or other properties. A source of light (such as a candle) may become invisible, though the light itself remains. The object's invisibility ends immediately if it is used in combat or if it leaves your person (such as by handing it to an ally).
