### 📜 Description
This spell functions as teleport except that you can opt to intentionally cause any number of the creatures traveling with you to suffer a mishap or arrive in a specific different location you visualize simultaneously with the original destination, or both.

Attempts to identify treacherous teleport with a skill check incorrectly identify it as teleport (see the ruse descriptor).
