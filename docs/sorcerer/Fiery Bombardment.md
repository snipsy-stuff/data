### 📜 Description
This spell sends forth a bolt of fiery destruction that massively explodes when it strikes its target. The explosion deals 1d8 points of damage per level (maximum 20d8) to all creatures and unattended objects within its area. Half of this is fire damage, but the other half is a result of the concussive force of the explosion and therefore is not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. If the explosion encounters a barrier such as a wall, and the damage is enough to break through the barrier, then the area of effect continues through to the other side. Otherwise the spell's area of effect stops at the barrier. Unlike most instantaneous duration spells, fiery bombardment can set fire to combustibles within the area of effect upon a failed save.
