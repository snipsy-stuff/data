### 📜 Description
With this spell, the caster causes the creatures targeted to see their world as a dead and horrific place. The affected targets see all living creatures surrounding themselves as hideous undead zombies, and the rest of their surroundings as a hellish nightmare. Buildings looked burned and ruined; food looks spoiled; even the sky appears black and ominous. This apocalyptic nightmare is so terrifying that the targets are cowered. A successful disbelief results in the creatures just being shaken for 1 round.
