### 📜 Description
One weapon you wield briefly changes into a brilliant energy weapon. A significant portion of one weapon you are wielding transforms into light, although this does not modify the item's weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects. The benefits of this spell can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons and ammunition.
