### 📜 Description
This spell blasts the targeted subject with a beam of scintillating light, which then refracts into an area prismatic spray that can strike secondary targets. You must first hit the primary target with a ray attack as a ranged touch attack. If it hits, the target is subjected to all seven colored effects of a prismatic spray spell, with a separate saving throw required for each effect. A single spell resistance check is allowed against the entirety of the spell; if it is made, the entire spell is negated. The spell likewise fails if the initial ray attack misses. 

After striking the primary target, the beam splits into a rainbow of beams spreading in a 10 ft. radius from the initial target. Creatures within this area are struck by one or more beams of light with the power of a prismatic spray (consult the prismatic spray spell). Creatures with 8 HD or less struck by either primary or secondary beams are automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds.
