### 📜 Description
You claim the breath weapon of the target creature for yourself. If the target creature fails a Fortitude save, you gain its natural breath weapon for the duration of the spell. If the target does not have a natural breath weapon, the spell fails

Your breath weapon is identical to the target creature's, including its frequency and associated saving throw and saving throw DC. If the breath weapon has an energy type, this spell gains the energy type as a descriptor. The target cannot use its breath weapon while this spell is active.

You cannot steal a breath weapon that does more than 15 dice of damage.
