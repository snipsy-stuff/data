### 📜 Description
A favorite of kobolds everywhere (and created by the crafty creatures), this spell causes a Small-sized creature to instantly grow up to the size, height and weight of an ogre. This increase changes the creature's size to Large. The target gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, a -4 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.

This size increase to Large grants the target a natural reach of 10 ft. and makes it occupy a 10-ft. square. This spell does not change the target's speed.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and can make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it. This spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage, as they increase to Large. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.

This spell is counters and dispels the spell giant to kobold .
