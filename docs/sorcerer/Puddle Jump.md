### 📜 Description
You move from one body of water directly to another within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) and within line of sight without passing through the intervening space. Each body of water must have a surface area large enough to accommodate the passage of your body. (You cannot move between a glass of water and a dewdrop, for example.)

After making a puddle jump, you can't take any actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. Your familiar is the only creature you can bring along with you. In an ocean or large lake, the same body of water can serve as both the origin and destination of the spell.
