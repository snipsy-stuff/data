### 📜 Description
You produce vertical strokes of lightning that flash downward for 1 round, dealing creatures and objects in the area 1d6 points of nonlethal damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5), or half-damage on a successful Reflex save. On a failed save, creatures are also dazzled for 1 round and catch on fire, immediately taking an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature catching on fire continues to burn in subsequent rounds unless it makes a DC 15 Reflex save to put out the flames). The lightning strokes ignite unattended, flammable objects in the area.
