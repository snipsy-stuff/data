### 📜 Description
Uncanny utterance expands and amplifies your speech, making it easy for you to be heard by any affected creatures looking in your direction-they hear your voice as if you were 5 ft. away. As long as an affected creature is looking in the direction of the caster, the sound remains audible to them even if the caster is far away and barely visible. Any creature that hears the uncanny utterance receives a Will save to disbelieve the spell. Each affected creature may also voluntarily look away to stop hearing the utterance on their next turn.
