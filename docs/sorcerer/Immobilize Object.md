### 📜 Description
This spell causes the object or construct touched to be pinned in place, even defying gravity (the Combat Maneuver and Escape Artist DC are equal to 10+your caster level + your relevant casting ability modifier). The object can hold up to 2,000 pounds plus 600 pounds per level (the spell ends if more weight is placed on the object). Similarly, a creature can end the spell by pushing against the target object with a successful Strength check (DC equal to the spell's DC). 

A creature caught within immobilized armor is entangled and pinned until the armor is removed or the creature makes a successful Combat Maneuver or Escape Artist check.
