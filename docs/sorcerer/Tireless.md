### 📜 Description
The target requires no food, drink, or rest, and gains the stamina of a machine. This allows the target to move three times its normal overland movement rate, perform three times the usual amount of labor (such as crafting a magical item or potion), or read and learn material at three times the normal rate. Creatures under the effects of this spell are immune to non-magical fatigue and exhaustion and suffer no consequences for not sleeping or for overexertion. Tireless has no effect on magical fatigue or exhaustion.
