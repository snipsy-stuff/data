### 📜 Description
You can control a construct you have built with Hit Dice equal to or less than your level. You can manipulate objects with your construct as precisely as its construction allows.

The construct uses the caster's base attack bonus (modified by the construct's Strength and Dexterity scores) and saving throw modifiers for Reflex and Will saving throws. You can use the manipulators of the construct to perform any number of skill-based tasks, using the construct's Strength and Dexterity modifiers when using skills based on those particular abilities.

Your body remains immobile, as if paralyzed, for the duration of the spell. The construct must remain within 100 ft. +10 ft. per level of the caster. If it moves beyond this distance the spell immediately ends and the caster's mind returns to his body.
