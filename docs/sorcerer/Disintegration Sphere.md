### 📜 Description
You create what appears to be a sphere of annihilation except any matter that comes in contact with a sphere suffers 100 hp of damage; only if this damage is enough to kill/destroy the creature/object, is it instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. A successful Fortitude save results in 15 points of damage. A successful save that kills/destroys the creature or object still results in utter destruction. In all other ways it functions like a sphere of annihilation. (For example: you still must make control checks to move it.) This sphere affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as forceful hand or a wall of force (creating a 2 ft. diameter hole), but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic field.
