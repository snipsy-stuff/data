### üìú Description
You summon an animated star mote that has a mystic connection to you. It appears where you designate, and it acts immediately on your turn. Each round it can make a move and a standard action. It has a fly speed of 30 ft. (perfect). You can direct it as a move action. As a standard action, it can either shoot a ray of searing hot light at a creature within 30 ft., or it can unleash a 20-ft. burst of light.

f you shoot the ray, it uses your ranged touch attack modifier on the attack. On a hit, the ray deals 1d8 hp damage for every two levels you possess (maximum 10d8). If this ray hits a creature that is vulnerable to light (per the Universal Monster Rules), it also blinds that creature for 1 round.

If you use the burst, those within the radius must succeed a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 hp damage for every three of your levels (maximum 6d6). Creatures vulnerable to light that fail their saving throw are also blinded for 1 round per level. Creatures that successfully save take half damage from the burst and are not blinded, if applicable

The star mote can be attacked. It is a Diminutive animated object with an AC of 22 (touch 16, flat-footed 14) and it uses your CMD. It has a hardness of 10, and 5x your level hp. It uses your saving throws, but it is immune to mind-affecting effects, bleed, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, stunning, and effects that require a Fortitude saving throw (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). The star mote is not subject to ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, or nonlethal damage. It cannot be healed or repaired. When the duration of the spell expires, the spell is dismissed, or the star mote is destroyed, it collapses into a small pile of stardust.
