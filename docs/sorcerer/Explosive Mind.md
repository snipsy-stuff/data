### 📜 Description
You cause the brain and cranial fluids of the subject to expand very rapidly, causing its head to explode. Creatures suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and suffer from the nauseated condition until the damage is healed. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 6d6 points of damage and suffers from the sickened condition until the damage is healed.

Special Note: for ease of record keeping inform the PC or GM to mark this damage as special, this damage is always the first damage healed by any and all effects.
