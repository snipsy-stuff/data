### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of a nude nymph into the subject's mind. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal nymph. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm nymph touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or become permanently blinded and stunned for 2d4 rounds. Remove blindness, or any spell that can remove a curse, can free the victim with a DC equal to this spell's DC. Otherwise, the effect cannot be dispelled. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 4d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal nymph attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the lich can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
