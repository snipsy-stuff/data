### 📜 Description
A fist-sized chunk of superheated rock shoots from your hand toward a creature, object, or point in space you target, trailing fire and emitting an ear-splitting scream as it goes. The screaming star deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6) to all creatures and objects along the line of its path (half fire damage, half sonic damage). When it then reaches its target, it explodes in a 15-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6, half fire, half sonic). A successful Reflex save reduces damage by half for creatures in the spell's path, for the target, and for all creatures and objects within the burst, but if a target creature or object fails its save, the shooting star deals it an additional 1d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6).
