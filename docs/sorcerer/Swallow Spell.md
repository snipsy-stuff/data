### üìú Description
The caster soaks a papyrus spell scroll in beer then consumes it. This allows him to commit the spells on the scroll to memory. One level of spells/caster level may be swallowed and safely memorized. No spell swallowed may exceed 5th level. Multiple castings of this spell will not allow the caster to exceed the one level of spells/caster level limit; e.g., casting swallow spell twice won't give a 10th-level caster the ability to swallow 20 levels worth of scrolls. If a spell memorized in this manner is expended, then a new casting of swallow spell would allow the caster to swallow a replacement scroll of the expended spell's level.
