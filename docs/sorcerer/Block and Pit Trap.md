### üìú Description
You open up an extra dimensional hole in the ground or floor and summon a 10-foot square block of stone above the hole that falls, fitting seamlessly into the hole. If the hole is opened directly below a creature, the creature is smashed into the hole, taking 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage from the block and 1d6 for every 10 feet it forces the creature to fall. Only creatures directly above the pit risk falling in. Creatures are buried by the stone block at the bottom of the pit; it takes 1 minute to uncover a creature buried at the bottom of the pit; a buried creature can free itself with a successful Strength Check DC 19. Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to move to safely to the nearest open space (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) but it still suffers the damage from being struck by the stone block as it leaves the area. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw, with a +2 bonus, to avoid falling into it. At any point during the duration of the spell other targets may be forced into this pit by means such as a bull rush. Those creatures do not receive a saving throw.

The pit's smooth, greased, stone walls have a Climb DC of 30 and a climber must make a successful Reflex save each round or be forced to move at half his climbing rate. Once the spell ends, the pit and the block disappear and the creature is deposited harmlessly on the surface.
