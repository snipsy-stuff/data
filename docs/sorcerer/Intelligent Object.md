### 📜 Description
You temporarily give an item or object the semblance of intelligence. The item is of the same alignment that you are and is considered friendly towards you. The target object can see and hear as a normal human could within a range of 60 feet, and it can speak and read any two languages you can. 

If the wielder of the targeted item tries to uses it against you or your allies, the wielder must make a Will save or be unable to perform the desired action. Attacks with other weapons or abilities are unaffected.
