### 📜 Description
You create a swarm of whirling iridescent, multi-colored ioun stones in a 5-ft. square. The stones immediately explode, dealing 1d6 hp damage per level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half is bludgeoning damage and cannot be reduced by resistance to fire (but it can be reduced by damage reduction). In regards to damage reduction, at 9th level the stones count as cold iron; at 12th level, they count as cold iron and adamantine. (Although at 12th level the stones count as adamantine for the purpose of damage reduction, they do not ignore hardness).
