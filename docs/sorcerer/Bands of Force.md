### 📜 Description
With a successful combat maneuver check (your CMB for this spell is equal to your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier) your target opponent is entangled. It can also squeeze the target creature with a second successful combat maneuver check on the following round dealing 1d6 plus your relevant caster ability modifier hit points damage as an immediate action. A target can negate this spell by making a successful Combat Maneuver Bonus or Escape Artist check as a standard action (DC 10 +your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier).
