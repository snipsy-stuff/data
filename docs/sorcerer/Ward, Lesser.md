### üìú Description
This inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A lesser ward can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature of a specific type violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores. Wards can be set according to alignment, creature type, subtype, or species (such as "elf" or "aberration"). Wards also can be set to pass those of your religion or organization. They cannot be set according to appearance, class, Hit Dice, or level. Wards respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple lesser wards cannot function within 30 feet of each other. When casting the spell, you mark a clear design in paint, chalk, blood, scratch marks, or some other means. The ward can conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the ward remains quite obvious. Wards can be detected as traps (DC 10 + caster level) and disabled or bypassed (same DC); in addition they can also be dispelled. The non-detection spell can fool a ward. You can identify a lesser ward with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15). Identifying the ward does not discharge it, but it allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version [see below], type of damage caused, what spell is stored). 

Depending on the version selected, a ward either blasts the intruder or activates a spell:

Blast Ward: A blast deals 2d4 points of damage to one target. This damage is acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (your choice, made at time of casting). Those affected can make Reflex saves to take half damage.

Spell Ward: You can store any harmful 1st level spell that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your level at the time of casting. If the spell has targets, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect (such as a cloud), the area or effect centers on the intruder. All saves operate as normal, except that the Difficulty Class is based on the level and school of the lesser ward.
