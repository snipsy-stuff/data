### 📜 Description
Flatten causes the targets and their equipment to flatten, such that they are effectively two-dimensional, having only height and width. This enables them to fit under doors or through any opening as long as it gives them sufficient width. Despite the change, the targets still have the same weight and ability to manipulate objects that they normally would. The lack of depth makes the targets harder to see at certain angles. They gain a +8 circumstance bonus to AC and Stealth checks and lose all size penalties to AC and Stealth as well. All of the subject's weapon attacks, including natural weapons, are considered slashing weapons with a threat range of 18-20/x2.
