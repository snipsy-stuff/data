### 📜 Description
You must be standing on the ground to cast this spell. You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 400 feet plus 40 feet per caster level that instantly forces all flying creatures or aircraft (such as a balloon) to the ground. Creatures, aircraft and passengers suffer 1d6 points of damager per 10 feet traveled (maximum 20d6). A feather fall spell or successful Fly or Profession (appropriate to aircraft) check negates this damage, though the creature and aircraft is still forced to the ground. The DC for the check is 11 plus your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier. Creatures and aircraft cannot fly within the radius of the spell.
