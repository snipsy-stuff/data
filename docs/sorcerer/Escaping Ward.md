### 📜 Description
This ward grants you extra maneuverability when you avoid attacks against larger foes. While affected by this spell, when you are attacked and missed by a creature that is at least one size category larger than you, you can, as an immediate action, move up to 5 feet away from the attacking creature. You can increase this movement by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
