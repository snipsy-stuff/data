### 📜 Description
While divination spells are powerless to actually inflict any form of compulsion, sometimes the truth can be a far more effective weapon than any forced effect. By casting this spell at a target creature, the spellcaster grants it just that: the truth. Darkest knowing calls forth all of the unvarnished truths about the subject, such as its infinitesimal lifespan and its utter insignificance in the grand scheme of the cosmos, and reveals them to it in a single, mindbreaking moment; it is forced to confront these harsh truths in the space of a single heartbeat. The target's mind locks up and the target is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful save results in the target being staggered for 1 round instead and makes the subject immune to this spell for 24 hours.

The after effects of this spell can have a profound effect on a character or NPC, the exporation of which is left to the player, the GM, and GM adjudication.
