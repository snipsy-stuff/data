### 📜 Description
You draw an image of the last creature that touched the targeted item. Any creature with an intelligence score of 3 or below that touched the item is not revealed. You can draw an image of the last intelligent creature to touch the item within a number of days equal to your caster level with an extreme level of skill. If the item hasn't been touched for a number of days greater than your caster level you obtain no image at all. For example, a diviner investigating a murder can cast this spell on an item found at the murder scene and draw an image of who touched it last in hopes of identifying the killer or a witness. This spell can be fooled with illusions. For example, if a diviner cast this spell on a silver coin last touched by an elf that was affected by polymorph to look like a halfling, a mental image of the halfling with the silver coin in hand would be revealed. In addition, if the last person to touch the item was wearing a mask at the time he touched it, you draw only his masked face, although you still get an idea of his general size and shape.
