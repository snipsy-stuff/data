### 📜 Description
This spell animates one of your wands in a fashion similar to a dancing weapon. For the duration of the spell, you can utilize a wand with a move action as if you were holding it, leaving you free to take standard actions such as casting a spell, using another item, making an attack, etc. Using the wand requires charges to be spent at twice the normal rate.

While animated, the wand shares the same space as you and is considered wielded or held by you for all maneuvers and effects that target items. The wand accompanies you everywhere, whether you move by physical or magical means.

You can grasp the wand as a free action at any time, including when the spell ends, though this effectively ends the spell even if the duration has not yet expired. If you cannot grab the wand at the spell's expiration, it clatters to the ground unharmed (subject to GM discretion).

The caster may only have one wand animated at any given time; a second casting of the spell cancels the initial spell.
