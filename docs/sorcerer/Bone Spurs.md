### 📜 Description
You cause the bones of one creature to elongate suddenly and harden into spikes, which thrust out of its flesh. This eruption inflicts 1d6 points of damage to the subject. If the creature survives, it can then use the spikes as weapons for the duration of the spell. The spikes add +1 point of damage to any grapple, natural, or unarmed attacks the subject makes.
