### üìú Description
This spell allows you to augment your next vril blast by drawing life energy from your target. On any round in which you cast this spell as a swift action, you can sacrifice spells or spell slots as normal to create vril blasts. If you succeed on the blast's ranged touch attack, it deals damage as normal. On a successful attack, you gain temporary hp equal to the damage dealt. There is no save against this effect. You can't gain more than the subject's current hp + the subject's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hp disappear 1 hour later.

}If the target can cast arcane spells, you can siphon spell energy from the subject rather than gaining temporary hp. The vril blast deals damage as normal, but rather than gaining temporary hp, you drain 1 spell level or spell slot for every die of damage you inflict. Spellcasting targets lose a corresponding number of prepared spells or spell slots appropriate to the drained spell levels, chosen randomly. A successful Fortitude save avoids this draining effect, but not the damage.
