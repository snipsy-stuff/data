### 📜 Description
A slight disturbance in the flow of time confuses all nearby creatures, so they flinch or hesitate just a moment.

In combat, all participants (including you and those with readied or delayed actions) must reroll initiative and begin with the combatant immediately following you in the new initiative order. Only one casting of this spell is effective per combat; subsequent castings during a single combat fizzle with no effect.
