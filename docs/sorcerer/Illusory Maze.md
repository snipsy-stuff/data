### 📜 Description
This spell creates the illusion of a translucent, ever-changing maze of glass in the target area. Creatures in the area who believe the maze to be real cannot move more than 5 feet continuously in any one direction and can't move diagonally, forcing them to take a circuitous route to their destination.
