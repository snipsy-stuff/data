### üìú Description
You summon a black mass of seething energy that attracts creatures and devours the life force of those it touches.

When the spell takes effect, creatures within 90 ft. of the black well are pulled toward it a total number of squares equal to your level. Creatures pulled into the well suffer 1d8 hp negative energy damage per caster level (Fortitude save halves) and are affected as per hold person. A Will save negates this latter effect and the target takes no damage from the spell.

Creatures take damage only upon entering the well; they take no additional damage by remaining within it, but they do take additional damage by leaving and being pulled back in. Only one creature may be pulled into the well each round, but a total number of creatures equal to your CL can be squeezed into the single square. Other creatures pulled toward it are simply held next to it; any excess pull is deducted from their movement on their turn.

You are never drawn toward the black well, and you may stand near it and use it as a form of defensive terrain.

For example, a 13th-level sorcerer casts this spell among a party of adventurers; it centers 40 ft. from the dwarf (who is furthest away), 30 ft. from two humans, and adjacent to an elf. With 13 5-ft. squares to spend moving foes, the caster moves the elf one square into the well to take 13d8 hp negative energy damage. The two humans are both moved six squares adjacent to the well. The dwarf is unaffected.
