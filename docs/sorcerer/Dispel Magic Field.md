### 📜 Description
This spell functions similarly to greater dispel magic, except that this field allows the caster to perform a targeted greater dispel magic, as a swift action, against any spell within this spell's area of effect for the duration of the spell. Also, the caster may attempt to counter (as though through the use of a greater dispel magic) any magical spell targeted at the caster or targeted at any ally within the spell's area of effect. This spell only allows the caster to dispel two spell levels per caster level (to a maximum of 40 spell levels at 20th level). If the caster does not have enough levels left to dispel a spell, then the dispel automatically fails. The spell ends when there are no spell levels left to dispel, or when the duration expires.
