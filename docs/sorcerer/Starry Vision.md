### 📜 Description
You see the fate of all creatures in the spell's area. You can act on this knowledge with these effects:

- All creatures in the area are flat-footed against you for the spell's duration. You may move during any creature's turn in a round. This expends your move action this round.
- You gain a +8 insight bonus to your AC and any saving throws arising from the actions of a creature within the area of the spell.
-As a swift action, you can warn one other creature, which has not yet acted in a round, whether its spell or attack will fail. If the warned creature wishes, it may choose to take another action when it acts. The creature may reroll one failed attack roll this round against an affected creature, or the player may take a different action or attack a different target. For purposes of this spell, all attack actions are considered equivalent to one another, and all spellcasting actions are equivalent to one another.
