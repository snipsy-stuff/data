### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of a demilich in the subject's mind. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal demilich. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or fall prone and become permanently helpless (unable to perform mental or physical actions) believing its soul is trapped inside the demilich's soul gem. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 7d6 points of damage. Remove curse does not restore the individual; only crushing the gem spell focus restores the victim. 

If the subject of a phantasmal attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the creature can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its fear attack.
