### 📜 Description
This spell causes the target creature to lose one category of appendages, such as arms, legs, wings, tentacles, or tails. The target loses all its appendages of the chosen type, regardless of how many it originally had. 

The target loses any natural attacks provided by the missing limbs. A creature that loses its arms cannot use manufactured weapons or shields, and for the most part cannot hold items (it might be able to hold small items in its mouth). An arcane spellcaster who loses his arms cannot cast spells with somatic components. A creature that loses its arms suffers a -20 penalty to the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Craft, Disable Device, Escape Artist, Heal, Perform (any instruments), Sleight of Hand, and Swim (unless the creature has a swim speed). 

If the missing appendages provide a form of movement, the creature loses that movement type. If it has no other form of movement, the creature may squirm or drag itself five feet as a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity (this is not the same as a five-foot step). Creatures that lose their legs suffer a -20 penalty to the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, Stealth, and Swim. If the creature loses all of its limbs it is unable to perform or defend against combat maneuvers, otherwise it suffers a -5 penalty to CMB and CMD. Items held or worn by the formerly missing appendages remain and fall to the ground in the  creature's space. 

The GM may impose other penalties on creature with missing limbs as appropriate. For example, amanticore that loses its tail would probably also lose its spikes special attack.
