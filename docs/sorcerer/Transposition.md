### 📜 Description
You select up to four other targets, and you may instantly trade places with each other. As an immediate action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, any of the spell's recipients may teleport to the location of another recipient, which teleports to the first recipient's square. None of the creatures you designate may initiate a transposition with you, but you may initiate one with them.

The swap takes place instantaneously, so each creature involved in the swap must face the circumstances of any action(s) targeting the creatures before the exchange. The transposition must occur between two living creatures, but a recipient may initiate a transposition with an unconscious, sleeping, dying, or otherwise disabled recipient.
