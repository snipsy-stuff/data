### 📜 Description
As mirage arcana, except you can disguise or conceal creatures to the effect. 

Creatures remain disguised or invisible, as you desire, so long as they remain within the spell's area. A creature that interacts with the effect (such as being attacked by a creature disguised by the spell) and succeeds at a Will save sees through all elements of the illusion. A creature using an 8th level or lower divination spell (such as see invisibility or true seeing) or a spell like invisibility purge to pierce the illusion must make a successful caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level) or fail to overcome the illusion.
