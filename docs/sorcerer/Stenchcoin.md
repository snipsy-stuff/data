### 📜 Description
This rather unpleasant spell is more annoying than deadly, and it must be cast on a coin of any valuation. This stenchcoin is scentless until it is disturbed, for example, by being placed into a container or otherwise moved from its resting place. At this point, it excretes a foul odor similar to a combination of skunk and rotting meat. The scent permeates other nearby coins (if the stenchcoin is in a coin pile, a purse with other coins, etc.) and fill any closed container. After 1 hour, the stench fills a regular bag or backpack, and after 4 hours it fills an extra-dimensional space such as a bag of holding or a handy haversack.

If the container is open after that point, anyone within 5 ft. of the container must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.

Dealing with the stenchcoin requires finding it.  As other coins absorb scent, this process requires a DC 20 + level Perception check and 1 minute of work per 10 coins examined. As the scent spreads among all nearby coins, using detect magic on a stenchcoin in a pile of other coins will only indicate the 5-ft. square where the stenchcoin resides. If the stenchcoin is not with only coins, detect magic works as normal. Once found and discarded, the smell fades over several hours and can no longer cause nausea.
