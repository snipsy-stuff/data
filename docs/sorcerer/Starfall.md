### 📜 Description
You release a number of powerful force bolts from your body equal to your level. Each strikes a creature within line of sight. No more than 3 bolts can strike a single target. Creatures struck take 3d12 hp damage, and a Reflex save halves that damage. Those that fail their saving throw are also blinded and knocked prone.
