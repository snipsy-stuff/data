### 📜 Description
The subject of the spell gains the earth glide special ability as listed in the Universal Monster Rules. The subject can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence.

A move earth spell cast on an area containing the subject flings it back 30 ft., stunning it for 1 round unless the subject succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
