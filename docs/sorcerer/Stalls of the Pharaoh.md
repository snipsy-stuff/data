### 📜 Description
Your fingers appear covered by shining gold stalls (sheaths) with electricity crackling at the tips. As a standard action, for as long as the spell persists, you may release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 hp electricity damage/level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.

The lightning bolts you generate set fire to combustibles and damage objects in their paths. They can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage shatters or breaks through an interposing barrier, a bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier as any other spell effect does.
