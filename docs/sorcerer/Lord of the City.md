### üìú Description
You can cast lord of the city only within a settlement that is home to at least 100 people. The area must be considered a city, town, village, hamlet, or similar community (you cannot, for example, define 100 farmers living across hundreds of acres as a settlement). For the duration, you know the general status of the people in the city: content, rebellious, afraid, dying etc. You become aware of large-scale calamities or strong emotions - anything that affects at least 10 percent of the population or physically endangers 1 percent of the population. For example, in a city of 10,000 people, if 155 people had the plague, you would become aware of it (with no further details). If the city were under attack, you would become aware of it. If a major festival were occurring with a thousand people attending, you would know whether they were enjoying themselves. You would not learn of minor occurrences (two people attacked during a robbery, three people dying in an accident, five people dying of natural causes, and so on). 

Further, with 1 round of concentration, you can learn the location and status of a single individual you name, if that creature is within the settlement. You must have touched that creature or have something belonging to it in your possession at the time of the attempt. The ability to locate individuals is as powerful and accurate as with discern location. Lastly, once per level while the spell remains in effect, you can send a message to anyone in the settlement and get a reply as if you had cast sending.
