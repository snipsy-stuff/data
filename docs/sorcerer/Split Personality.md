### 📜 Description
You create a secondary, ever-present, and troublesome personality within the target's mind. Any time the target wishes to take an action (up to once per round), roll a d%. On a roll of 51 to 00, the target can take the action. On a roll of 1 to 50, the secondary personality wins out and the target does the opposite of the intended action (or as close as possible). For example, if he wanted to attack a foe, he attempts to heal or help the foe for a round instead. A successful save results in the target suffering from the confused condition for 1 round, but afterwards the target is immune to the secondary confusion effect of this spell for 24 hours. 

Remove curse does not remove split personality. Greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.
