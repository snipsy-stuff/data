### üìú Description
Resonance emits a high-pitched noise that is attuned to resonate with a specific type of substance, such as stone, iron, or even human flesh. The specific material is chosen at the time of casting. Within the area, only the type of material that has been selected takes damage from the spell. When used against inanimate objects, the spell simply deals 6d6 points of sonic damage per round to all objects of the chosen material that are within the area of effect. A Fortitude save (for attended or magical objects) negates this damage. Regardless, a new save is made every round. When used against living tissue, this spell has varying effects, depending on the particular tissue targeted. Some of the most common types are detailed bellow.

Flesh: Targeting flesh causes the targets muscle tissues to tear themselves apart. This not only deals 6d6 points of sonic damage per round, but also deals 1d4 points of Strength and Constitution damage per round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the sonic damage by half, and negates the Strength and Constitution damage. Regardless of the result, a new save is made every round.

Bones: Targeting bones causes the targets bones to break and crumble. The spell deals 6d6 points of sonic damage to affected creatures per round and furthermore deals 1d4 points of Dexterity and Constitution damage per round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the sonic damage by half and negates the Dexterity and Constitution damage. Regardless of the result, a new save is made every round.

Brain: Targeting the brain tissue of a living creature is especially lethal. If the creature fails its saving throw the creature takes 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage and is dazed for one round. Furthermore, the living creature must immediately make a second saving throw. If the second saving throw also fails, then the living creature suffers 10 points of damage per level. If the subject succeeds the initial saving throw, it suffers 10d6 points of damage. If the is enough damage to kill the creature its brain explodes. If the creature is still alive it suffers migraine headache and suffers -4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Regardless, a new save is made each round.

Any creature that is immune to sonic damage is also immune to the effects of the spell. A creature that is resistant to sonic damage gets a +1 to its saving throw for every 5 points of sonic resistance it possesses. This spell cannot be enhanced with the Silent Spell feat, or other effects that remove the verbal component.
