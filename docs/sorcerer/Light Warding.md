### 📜 Description
You draw an invisible line as a barrier against one or more types of creatures. When these creatures cross that line, the warding releases a powerful flare of light that is visible for miles..

The types of creatures affected must be set when the spell is cast; choose any of the standard monster types (aberration, humanoid, dragon, etc.) or subtypes (fire, law, incorporeal), plus one additional type or subtype per four levels. Only creatures of the chosen type trigger the spell.

Creatures with the shadow or dark subtype must make a Will save to cross through the warded square, even after the spell has been triggered. When the appropriate creature type or subtype enters a square where the spell is present, the light warding releases a burst of pure light. Creatures in any affected squares must make an immediate Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 hours The DC of this save increases by 2 for every 60 ft. of darkvision that the target has and by 1 for creatures with low-light vision.
