### 📜 Description
A cloud of inky darkness billows out from the point you designate. The darkness completely obscures all sight, including darkvision.
A creature within the cloud is considered to have full concealment; attacks against it suffer a 50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target.

Solid darkness is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at 1/10 normal speed (minimum of 5 ft. per round, although it cannot take a 5-ft. step), and all melee attack and melee damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The darkness prevents effective ranged weapon attacks by physical objects, but immaterial magic rays and the like are unaffected.

A creature or object that falls into solid darkness is slowed, so that each 10 ft. of darkness that the creature or object falls through reduces the damage of a fall by 1d6 hp, with a minimum damage of 0 hp.

For example, if a creature falls 30 ft. and then passes through 20 ft. of solid darkness before striking the ground, the total damage of the fall is 3d6 (or 5d6-2d6; accounting for total fall of 50 ft. with 20 ft. of the fall being through solid darkness).
