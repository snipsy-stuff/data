### 📜 Description
You steal away a creature's ability to rest or sleep. The target of this spell cannot sleep for 24 hours, possibly accruing penalties for fatigue in addition to being unable to heal naturally during that period. Creatures such as elves that normally do not sleep are immune to this spell. This spell can be countered by a sleep spell though it cannot be used to counter a sleep spell or any other magical means of inducing sleep.
