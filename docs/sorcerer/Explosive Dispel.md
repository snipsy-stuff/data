### üìú Description
Explosive dispel not only cancels magical effects just like greater dispel magic, but it also does so violently, releasing a burst of magical energy. Explosive dispel can accomplish one of the following: end ongoing spells that have been cast on a, creature or object, end, ongoing spells (or at least ,their effects) within an area, or counter another spell caster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired and deals 1d6 points of force damage per spell level to the target of the spell (or the caster in the case of a counterspell attempt). Thus, if explosive dispel successfully dispelled bull's strength, the target of that spell would suffer 2d6 points of force damage. Area effects that are dispelled deal the damage to all creatures in the area but allow a Reflex save for half damage. Any spell that cannot be defeated by greater dispel magic also cannot be defeated by explosive dispel. Explosive dispel can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. 

Unlike greater dispel magic you cannot use explosive dispel to suppress the abilities of a magic item. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Even your own spells explode when dispelled by explosive dispel.
