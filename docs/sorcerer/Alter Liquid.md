### 📜 Description
This spell transmutes one kind of nonmagical liquid into another. The liquid you affect must normally be liquid at about room temperature (65° F), you must have line of effect to it, and you can alter liquids in open containers, but not in sealed containers. You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum volume is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater volume than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 1st-level caster (1 pint maximum) could not affect any of the liquid in a 1-gallon container. The spell can transmute any type of mundane liquid (including fresh or salt water, wine, vinegar, alcohol, or lamp oil) but cannot affect or create acid, mercury, or any type of venom or poison. 

Transmuted liquids created by the spell have typical characteristics such as color, taste, smell, and potency. For example, if you turn water to ale, you get typical ale rather than any extra-strong or distinctive variety.
