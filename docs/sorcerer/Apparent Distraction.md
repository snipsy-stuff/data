### 📜 Description
This spell causes a loud sound that momentarily diverts other creatures' attention, While they are turning their attention away from you, you also as part of the casting can make a stealth check if you are within 10' of a hiding place of some kind. You move to that hiding spot and do not provoke attacks of opportunity; you can take no further actions until your next turn.
