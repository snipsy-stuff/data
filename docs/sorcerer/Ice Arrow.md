### üìú Description
An arrow of pure ice launches from your fingertip. Upon a successful ranged touch attack the arrow erupts, enveloping the target in a blast that deals 5d6 hp cold damage.

Furthermore, creatures up to Large size that are struck by the arrow are encased in a block of ice for 1 round/level. Each round, the subject may use a full-round action to attempt a Strength check against the spell's DC to break free of the ice. Encased creatures cannot take any actions other than breaking free, and the encasing ice provides DR 10/-. Any melee attack or spell that damages the creature shatters the ice block, freeing it. Additionally, creatures that are not threatened may, as a full-round action, attempt a Strength check against this spell's DC to break the ice and free the target.

For every five levels beyond 5th, you gain an additional ice arrow (two at 10th level, three at 15th level, and the maximum of four at 20th). You may target the same creature with more than one arrow, but once a creature is successfully struck and encased in ice, any additional arrows targeting it are wasted.
