### 📜 Description
This spell affects an object with a circular opening - such as a chamber pot, jug, mug, trophy, or urn - turning it into a magical sensor. As long the target is within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) of you, you can concentrate to activate the sensor. When you do so, you can hear through the sensor as if you were just inside the object. The sensor within the jug can be noticed as usual (observant creatures might notice a ghostly ear floating in the jug). The spell ends immediately if the target is damaged. This spell can be made permanent with a permanency spell (min. CL 14th, 15,000 gp).
