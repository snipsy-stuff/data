### 📜 Description
This spell creates a burst of air that attempts to forcibly remove wielded weapons from all creatures in the area of effect. The CMB for the disarm attempt equals your level + your primary spellcasting attribute's modifier + 2, and the spell makes one attempt for all applicable targets in the area. If the disarm attempt exceeds a target's CMD by 10, the target's weapon lands 10 ft. away from the target in a random direction (use rules for splash weapons to determine where it lands).
