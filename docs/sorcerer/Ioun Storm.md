### 📜 Description
Using six dull gray ioun stones (25 gp each) as a focus, you can tap into the dim residual energies of the stones and magnify them greatly. The stones buzz forth as a deadly bludgeoning swarm in a 10-ft. square. The focus stones multiply six-fold and swarm in a dizzying flurry, striking any creature within the area with bruising force.

Treat the swarm of ioun stones as a wasp swarm with these exceptions: construct and swarm traits instead of vermin and swarm traits; all damage is treated as bludgeoning; and the swarm has no poison ability. The ioun swarm moves as long as you actively direct it mentally (a move action); otherwise, it remains stationary.

When the spell ends, the original six dull gray ioun stones return to orbit the caster's head (unless the swarm has been destroyed, in which case they are simply lost), and all of the temporary duplicates vanish. This spell has no effect on ioun stones that are not burnt out.
