### 📜 Description
You create an extra-dimensional hole in the ground or floor. If opened directly below a creature, the creature falls through the hole, taking 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet it falls. Creatures that are unable to find their own way out are stuck at the bottom of the trap for the duration of the spell. Once the spell ends, the pit disappears and the creature is deposited harmlessly on the surface.

At any point during the duration of the spell other targets may be forced into this pit by means such as a bull rush. Those creatures do not receive a saving throw.

You may choose to expand the area of the effect, but for every five feet of width and length, the depth of the effect is halved.
