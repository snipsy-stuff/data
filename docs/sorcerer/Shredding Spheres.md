### 📜 Description
When this spell is cast, two hovering spheres made entirely of spinning blades come into being in a space you occupy. Each sphere can be directed to attack a target within the spell's range as a move action. If you direct both spheres at the same target, you may control them both with a single move action. The spheres have a fly speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability and automatically succeed on all Fly skill checks. You make a melee touch attack against each target using your base attack bonus, dealing 2d6 points of slashing damage on a successful hit. The spheres' attacks are treated as magic and cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Whenever a sphere moves outside of the spell's range, it flies back toward you at 30 feet per round until it is once more within range, where it can be controlled normally. Each sphere is AC 15, has a hardness of 10, and has 30 hit points.
