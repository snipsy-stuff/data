### 📜 Description
Program feat gives a construct the benefits of a single feat possessed by another creature the caster is touching when the spell is cast. The construct must meet all the prerequisites of the feat. The feat must be passive and require no thought to active for a nonintelligent construct to gain the benefit from it. (For example: Weapon Focus would work, but Power Attack would not.)
