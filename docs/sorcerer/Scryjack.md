### 📜 Description
The only thing better than keeping your plans unobserved is presenting disinformation to prying eyes. If you are aware of being the subject of any scrying spell, you may take control of that spell and show its caster what you wish him to see. You must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast the scrying spell. If you succeed, the spellcaster is unaware that you have cast scryjack and are now in control of the scrying spell. 

While the scryjack is in effect, you may cast mind-affecting spells on the caster of the original scrying spell. If you do so, or if you show the spellcaster images that are obviously unreal, he becomes aware (if he was not already) that you have cast scryjack.
