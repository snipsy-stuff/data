### 📜 Description
This spell functions as invisibility, but in addition to being hidden from normal sight the target’s appearance to all senses becomes diffused in time, flashing ahead or lagging behind her actual movements by a moment. This asynchronous imaging makes it difficult to locate the target precisely, granting the effect of blur even against creatures that can see invisible or if invisibility is temporarily suppressed by invisibility purge or a similar effect. This sensory dissociation affects extraordinary senses including blindsight, but true seeing and similar effects that allow a creature to see through illusions or effects that specifically negate concealment from illusions negate this effect.

Asynchronous invisibility is broken when if target attacks, as normal; however, because of the temporal lag in her image she does not become visible until the end of her turn (if the target attacks when it is not her turn, such as an attack of opportunity, she instead becomes visible at the beginning of her next turn).

The temporal dissociation caused by this spell causes minor dizziness and disorientation when the target’s image “snaps back” to its proper temporal location, causing the target to become dazzled for 1d4 rounds after the spell expires. In addition, each time the caster uses this spell, there is a 1% non-cumulative chance that a hound of Tindalos takes note of the temporal anomaly and begins to hunt the target.
