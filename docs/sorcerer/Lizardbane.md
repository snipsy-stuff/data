### 📜 Description
You make an existing fire erupt into a geyser of liquid flame that targets reptiles and all draconic creatures. The single fire source required (as small as a torch's flame, but not a candle or lantern) is immediately extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-ft. cube, however, is only partly extinguished, with the details up to the GM's discretion (a targeted volcano's magma might harden in a 20-ft. cube, or a forest fire might burn out in same area). Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 hp damage per level with no saving throw.

The resulting rain of fire seeks out reptilian creatures and those with the dragon subtype. It fills a hemispherical burst with a radius of 60 ft. All affected creatures and objects in the area take 3d6 points of fire damage and catch fire (see the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook).

With a successful Reflex save, an affected creature takes half damage and does not catch fire. Creatures within 120 ft. of the original fire source are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).
