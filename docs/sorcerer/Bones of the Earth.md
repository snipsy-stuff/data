### 📜 Description
This spells digs a pit through earth, clay, or stony ground, but it cannot dig through walls, worked stone, metal, or other harder materials. The pit is 20 ft. long and wide. It is 10 ft. deep plus 5 ft. per 2 caster levels. All creatures adjacent to the pit edge (or within one of the squares made suddenly into a pit) are entitled to a Reflex save to avoid falling and thus taking damage. The Climb DC is 15.

You can dismiss the spell, but doing so collapses the pit. Creatures caught within a collapsed pit take 1d6 hp bludgeoning damage per minute for every 20 ft. of depth. There is no save to avoid this damage. Affected creatures are immobile and begin to suffocate until they make one successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 25 Escape Artist check for every 10 ft. they must climb.

At the end of the spell duration, you may choose to slowly restore the earth rather than collapsing the pit. This slow closing is not possible if the pit is closed by external forces, such as a dispel magic spell, which instantly collapse the pit.
