### 📜 Description
You shoot a ray of energy at the intended target. This ray passes through walls, doors, or any other solid object in the path to the target, thus negating any cover. Unlike most spells, you do not need a line of sight for the spell to be cast. To hit the target, you must succeed at a ranged touch attack. If you are successful, you deal 1d6 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Undead and constructs are immune to this spell. This spell does not make it any easier to locate the target, (remember that, unlike a targeted spell, when using ray spells you do not have to be able to see your target) thus you may have to guess the location of the target. Even if you hit the target's square, it may still benefit from total concealment (causing a 50% miss chance).
