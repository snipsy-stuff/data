### 📜 Description
There are seven variants of this spell, one for each of the Thassilonian schools of magic. Each functions like sepia snake sigil (and counts as that spell for the purpose of combining other spells that hide or garble text), except instead of trapping the subject, the triggered sigil's effect depends on this spell's school. This effect lasts for 1 day/level. This is a curse effect that can be removed via remove curse.

Illusion: The target's vision is blurred, giving it a -4 penalty on Perception checks relating to vision, and the target treats all other creatures as having displacement. This is a glamer effect.
