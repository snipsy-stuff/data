### üìú Description
This powerful spell is primarily used to frighten trespassers away from your stronghold. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area, these illusionary effects are defended against divinations (such as clairvoyance, detect spells, true seeing and see invisibility) unless the caster makes a successful caster level check (DC 15 plus your caster level).

Ghostly Sounds: This can be the sound of a rattling chain, a low moan, the sound of a breaking branch, a creaking door, someone whispering their name.

Glimpse of Something: You catch a momentary glimpse of something: an object moved, the eyes of a painting followed you, a secret door closed, a vague form outside a window, a monster under a bed.

Monster of Shadow: You can create a specific guardian monster as a shadow conjuration spell, this monster can appear and disappear as per the vanishing effect at will; the effect generates the creature again in 12 hours.

Vanishing: One creature per caster level selected by you at the time of casting can become invisible and inaudible as an immediate action so long as they remain within the wards, if the creature attacks, this ability is negated for 1 hour.

Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by a silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall.

In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.

1. Phantom trap on four doors.

2. A magic mouth in two places.

3. Major image in two places.

4. Illusionary script in one corridor or room (usually blood on a wall).

5. A zone of silence in one place.

The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the illusion school. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful mage's disjunction destroys the entire haunted grounds effect.
