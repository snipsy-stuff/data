### üìú Description
Spellsnare imbues a gem with the power to absorb a spell, and then to later release its energy. The gem becomes invisible and incorporeal and is tied to a specific creature, object, or 10-footcube of space, designated by you. If associated with a creature or object, the gem moves when the creature or object moves, remaining always within 1 foot. The gem stays dormant until someone casts a particular spell (which can be of any level), which you specified earlier, on the creature, object, or area. At this time the gem activates, absorbing the spell and becoming visible and tangible. An active gem no longer moves, even if it had been tied to a moving creature or object. The triggered gem floats right where it is, defying gravity. If anything or anyone touches the gem after it has become active, it explodes, ruining the gem and inflicting 2d6 points of force damage for each level of the spell it absorbed to all within a 20-foot spread (Reflex save for half damage). Only one spellsnare can be tied to a specific creature, object, or 10-footcube or space (neither gem will function if a tied creature also carries a tied object, or enters a tied area).
