### 📜 Description
You grant the recipient of this spell the ability to withstand the environmental perils of the murky ocean depths. The recipient gains the ability to breathe underwater, a +4 enhancement bonus on Swim checks, darkvision out to a range of 30 feet, cold resistance 5, and immunity to pressure caused by deep water. In addition, while affected, the recipient can move and attack normally with melee weapons while underwater, even slashing and bludgeoning weapons. Dive does not make creatures unable to breathe air if they cannot normally do so.

Special: If a GM wishes, this spell can replace control water as the 4th-level spell for the cleric’s Oceans domain.
