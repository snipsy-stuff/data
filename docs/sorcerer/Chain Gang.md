### üìú Description
You bind a group of people to each other and to you. Those bound are unable to leave the sight of the group as a whole, though they can create a chain so that one member has line of site with another member. If a member of the group is not in line of sight of the group, that individual is teleported back to the closest member of the group. The caster of chain gang can teleport a single member, or the group as a whole, to her as a full-round action once a day for a duration of up to 1 hour. During this time, this spell is suppressed for that hour, but she can dismiss this effect returning them to their original location as an immediate action. A dispel magic or mage's disjunction effect targeting or affecting the individuals or the group has no effect, the whole of the group, the caster, and the spell focus must be present for those spells to be effective. Otherwise, the spell only ends if You bind a group of people to each other and to you.
