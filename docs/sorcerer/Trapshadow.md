### 📜 Description
Trapshadow increases the detection DC of a trap by an amount equal to half your level. This is an illusion effect, and any one touching the trap is able to make a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. (Usually, however, touching the trap also trips it.)

If dispel magic is cast on the trapped area, it may dispel this spell if it is the highest-level spell in the area. Also, if the trap is discharged, trapshadow ends and must be recast.
