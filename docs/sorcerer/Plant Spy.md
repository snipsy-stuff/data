### 📜 Description
You make a plant into a spy of sorts. For the duration of the spell, all visible and auditory activities that occur within fifty feet of the plant are "stored" magically within the plant. At any time afterward, you (and only you) can touch the plant and experience the information stored within it. Once you have accessed the information, you cannot do so again. The plant's "senses" are the same as a normal human's (regardless of the race of the caster) - it cannot see in the dark, it cannot see invisible creatures, and so on.
