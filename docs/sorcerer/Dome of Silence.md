### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, an invisible dome encompasses the area around you, creating a damper for any sound traveling into or out of the area. Creatures and objects can pass through the dome normally, and if they do they receive a +10 bonus to any Perception checks made to notice a slight, wavering sound as they pass through the dome's barrier.

Anyone outside the dome takes a -20 circumstance penalty applied to any Perception checks made to hear noises from inside the dome, and vice versa. This allows for private conversations in public areas. Those inside the dome are only affected by sound-based or language dependent spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities if they can first make a Perception check (with the dome's applied -20 penalty) to hear them. Any attack that does sonic damage and passes through the dome dispels the dome, but the dampening effect of the dome reduces the attack's damage by half before any saving throw is made.
