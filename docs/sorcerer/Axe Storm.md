### 📜 Description
A roiling, clanking cloud appears and rains axes down on all creatures in the designated area. The axes deal 4d6 hp slashing damage to each creature in the area, and they bypass damage reduction as if they were magical, silver weapons. By using as this spell's material component replica axes crafted from different special materials other than silver (which increases the total material component cost), your axes bypass damage resistance or hardness per the special material. As a move action, you can direct the axe storm to move 60 ft. before it rains more axes down on its victims.

The axes conjured by the axe storm remain until the spell ends.
