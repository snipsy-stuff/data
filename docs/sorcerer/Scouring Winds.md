### 📜 Description
This spell brings forth a windstorm of stinging sand that blocks all vision. You can move the storm up to 30 feet each round as a move action. Any creature in the area takes 3d6 points of piercing damage each round. The area is considered a windstorm (see Table 13-10: Wind Effects, Core Rulebook 439). If a creature with spell resistance successfully resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still unable to see within the area of the spell.
