### 📜 Description
A bolt of chaos energy blasts from you into another creature, dealing damage and disrupting their spell casting and spell like abilities. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike a target. A hit deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 levels (maximum 10d6) from chaotic energy. Thereafter, for one round per level, unless the subject makes a Wisdom check (DC 10 + your relevant caster ability modifier) the spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items the subject actives cause a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps). A subject could take a 10 or a 20 on this check if conditions made this possible.
