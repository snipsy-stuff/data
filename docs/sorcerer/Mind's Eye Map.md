### 📜 Description
A mind's eye map allows you to magically craft a map taken directly from the target's mind, using yourself as a conduit. You spill a steady stream of ink upon the chosen surface for the map, which slowly undulates and forms shapes that perfectly copy the target's mental image; 100 sq. ft. of space may be mapped per minute. The map is only as complete as the target knows or can recall, and it includes any illusions, visual tricks, or inaccuracies the target witnessed.

If the target is unwilling, you may attempt to forcefully extract the mental image, but you must succeed on a touch attack and paint a cipher on the creature. An unwilling target is allowed a Will save; success negates the spell. Another mind's eye map reflecting the same mapped area cannot be created from the same unwilling target until the caster advances in level (or until the target becomes willing).

If you paint the cipher on an unwilling target with arcane mark, the DC for the Will save increases by +2.
