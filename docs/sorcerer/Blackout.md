### 📜 Description
You create an area that looks like shifting shadows to anyone with darkvision. Anyone looking through the area of a blackout with darkvision cannot see into or past the area of this spell. Normal light sources are not blocked by this spell, however, and it does not interfere with normal or low-light vision or any other senses. Like darkness, this spell may be cast on an object.
