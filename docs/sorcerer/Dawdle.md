### 📜 Description
Dawdle causes a creature to suffer a -4 circumstance penalty to its initiative and a -1 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves. During the round dawdle is in effect, the target creature's initiative check is 4 less than it normally would be - the initiative check reverts to its original position in the following round.
