### 📜 Description
If any conjuration (teleportation) supernatural, spell or spell-like ability is used within the area of this spell, or if the area of the spell is the target of a conjuration (teleportation) spell or effect, the destination of the teleport spell is redirected to a location you chose, within the warded area, when you cast teleport transfer. For example, a dragon could cast teleportation transfer in its lair, with a dungeon cell equipped with a crushing stone trap as a destination. Now, if anyone in the dragon's lair attempts to cast teleport, it ends up in the cell. 

The whole area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A dispel magic cast on a specific area, if successful, allows for normal teleportation to work in that area. A successful mage's disjunction destroys the entire teleport transfer effect.
