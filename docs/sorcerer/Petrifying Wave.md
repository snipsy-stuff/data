### 📜 Description
A wave ripples out from you, turning everything in its path to stone, including creatures, plants, and manufactured objects. (Objects in a creature's possession turn to stone or save as the creature does, do not roll for each item separately.) 

Unlike most spells, physical barriers and things that block line of effect do not protect against petrify; the wave merely turns the barrier to stone then continues to petrify everything behind it. A wall of force, a prismatic wall/ sphere or an antimagic field will halt the progression of the petrifying wave. 

A stone to flesh spell restores victims of this spell to their natural states, even if they were not made of flesh (a tree for example) a miracle or wish spell can revert all creatures at once.
