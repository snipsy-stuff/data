### 📜 Description
You create a shimmering 10 ft. square cube of magically enhanced, transparent glass. This glass house can be used as a means to trap opponents that can fit within the cube (Reflex save avoids), or it can be used as a protective enclosure for the caster and any companions that can fit inside of it. When created, the glass house must be supported by a solid surface below it capable of holding 500 pounds or the spell fails. The glass house has hit points equal to triple your caster level and its break DC is 20 + your caster level. The walls of the glass house have resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire 10 and have DR 15/bludgeoning. 

If any creatures are inside the glass house when it breaks, they take 3d6 total points of slashing and piercing damage from the exploding glass walls.
