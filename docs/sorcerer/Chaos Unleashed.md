### üìú Description
You twist the tap of chaos in the area creating a chaos field that causes all spells and spell-like abilities to be altered. Any time a spell or spell-like ability is used within the area of effect, roll on the chart below.

d%        Result 01-05  The spell targets you, or if an area of effect, it centers on you. If it cannot target you or center on you, the spell simply fails.

06-10 Wild spell energy deals 1d4 points of damage per spell level to you.

11-15 The spell affects a random target or area of effect. The GM should randomly determine a different target from among those in range of the spell. If the spell has no specified target or area of effect, it simply fails.

16-20 A random spell that you have prepared (or a random spell you know if you cast spontaneously) occurs, targeted as close to your original target as the parameters of the spell allow. The slot of the spell that occurs is expended instead of the one you intended to cast. It is possible the random spell could be the one you originally intended. The spell that occurs is (1d6: 1-2, one level lower than; 3-4, the same level as; 5-6, one level higher than) the spell you were originally casting. If you have no spells of this level, the mishap has no effect.

21-25 The spell fails, but its energies manifest as a luck penalty to all your ability checks, skill checks, saving throws, attack rolls, or level checks for the next minute. This penalty is equal to 1 + the spell's level.

26-30 Wild spell energy deals 1 point of damage per spell level to any creatures or objects that would have been affected by the spell.

31-35 Nothing happens. The spell fails just as if it were disrupted in casting.

36-40 Odd sensory elements and bizarre (but harmless) phenomena occur in the area of effect the spell would have affected, lasting as long as the spell's duration would have lasted.

41-45 Bestow curse on you.

46-50 The spell functions normally, but your next spell automatically mishaps, with a -20 luck penalty to the roll.

51-55 The spell fails, but the wild spell energy leaves a permanent change in your body. The change is no more drastic than that which alter self can achieve.

56-60 Nothing happens. The spell does not function, just as if it were never cast, and thus costs the spellcaster no spell slots or material components.

61-65 For as long as the spell's duration would have lasted, your appearance changes in moderate ways, such as alteration of the size, color, or shape of a body part, your facial appearance, or your sex. The change is no more drastic than that which alter self can achieve.

66-70 The spell functions, but odd sensory elements and bizarre (but harmless) phenomena accompany it for its duration.

71-75 Spell appears to function normally, but is only an illusion. Will DC 20 to disbelieve if interacted with. If the spell has no obvious sensory effects (like charm person), nothing happens.

76-80 The spell functions normally, but your next spell automatically mishaps.

81-85 The spell fails, but its energies manifest as a luck bonus to all your ability checks, skill checks, saving throws, attack rolls, or level checks for the next minute. This bonus is equal to 1 + the spell's level.

86-90 The spell functions normally, but with subtle changes in its appearance, such as fireballs being green, or a fly spell leaving a trail of feathers.

91-95 The spell functions normally, but you can cast it again. The spell slot or prepared spell is not expended, nor are any material components.

96-00 The spell functions at full potential, automatically defeating spell resistance and not allowing a saving throw to resist.
