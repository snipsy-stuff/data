### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, the sound of a deep, tolling bell seems to ring out from somewhere above and beyond. Your designated targets are overcome with an impending sense of doom. Each round the bell tolls, targets must make a Will save or suffer a -1 penalty to attack, damage, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws, as your spell erodes their resolve (the maximum penalty is -15).

Additionally, when a target of tolling doom is attacked, their opponent receives a bonus to confirm critical hits equal to the total penalty accrued by the target (e.g. a target suffering a -3 penalty grants a +3 bonus to an attacker's critical confirmation rolls.)

This spell has no effect on a target without an Intelligence score.
