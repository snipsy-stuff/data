### 📜 Description
You form the air around you into a compressed, wing-shaped blade of wind that produces a characteristic whistling sound when you launch it at your targets. If you make a successful ranged touch attack against your target, the blade deal 1d8 hp slashing damage.

For every three levels you possess, if your touch attack hits the target, the blade can strike another target within range or whip around to strike the same target again (to a maximum of five attacks at 15th level).

If you rolled a natural 20 on any ranged touch attack, on your next round as a move action you may continue to attack with the whistling whorl up to the maximum attacks you can generate with the spell. You may continue to do this up to the spell duration as long as you hit your targets and roll a natural 20 each round.
