### 📜 Description
A giant, glowing symbol of wrath appears below you, forcibly repulsing all nearby creatures. All creatures within the area of effect take 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are subjected to a bull rush that attempts to push them directly away from you. The blast’s bull rush effect is treated as having Strength 25 + your Intelligence modifier, but gains no other bonuses for size or charging. You are unaffected by both the spell’s damage and bull rush effect.
