### 📜 Description
This spell is only effective when it is cast on the site of a great battle or another large-scale slaughter that took place within the last 500 years.

When cast, raise undead host causes skeletons or zombies (your choice) to burst out of the ground and obey your commands to follow you, guard an area, or attack your opponents, as per the animate dead spell. All undead created have a +1 profane bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, as well as +1 hp per HD, as per the desecrate spell. You create no more undead than 8 HD per level, no matter how many times you cast the spell. Any excess visible bodies do not animate. You may release any number of undead from your control at any time, but they still count toward your total for purposes of this spell. Undead controlled using the Command Undead feat, however, do not count toward your limit of undead as described in this spell.
