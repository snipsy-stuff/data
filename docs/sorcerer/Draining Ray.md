### 📜 Description
You shoot forth a black and purple ray that strikes with an appalling and shadowy chill. With a successful ranged touch attack, you drain 1d6 points of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution from your target; these ability score points are then added to your own totals as an enhancement bonus for 1 round per caster level you possess. If the victim makes a Fortitude save, you drain just 2 points of Constitution.
