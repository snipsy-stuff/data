### 📜 Description
You discern all curses, afflictions, and detrimental effects present in a number of creatures or objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object and learn, as a free action, how to dispel, remove or negate these effects. In the case of a magic item or artifact, you also learn how to destroy the object. In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.

An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze malady spells for 24 hours.
