### 📜 Description
This spell wraps its subject in jagged shards of stone and slabs of slate, granting a +4 natural armor bonus to AC and immunity to the paralyzed and petrified conditions. As the stone and slate created is magical in nature, the armor does not confer an arcane spell failure chance or armor check penalty, nor does it slow movement.

In addition, any creature that moves adjacent to the subject or begins its turn adjacent to the subject takes 1d6 hp slashing damage +1 hp/caster level (maximum +10). A Reflex save halves this damage. The spell does not differentiate between friend and foe, but an armor of the mountains spell cannot affect the caster.

If the subject takes more than 10 hp damage in a round from a magical source with the air descriptor, the stone armor crumbles and the spell ends.
