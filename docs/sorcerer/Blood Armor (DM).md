### üìú Description
When you successfully strike a creature with a melee weapon and deal damage to it, you can cast blood armor as a swift action. The blood allowing from your foe magically increases in volume and forms a suit of plate armor around you, granting you a +6 armor bonus to AC for the spell's duration. Additionally the armor prevents any of your own blood from flowing too copiously, making you immune to bleed effects.

Unlike mundane armor, blood armor has no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Unlike mage armor, blood armor is not a force effect and thus incorporeal creatures can bypass it normally. The foe you strike must be one that contains blood-targets immune to bleed effects cannot be used as the focus for this spell.

If the focus of this spell has divine blood (demigods, outsiders with 20 or more HD, or characters with godling class levels from The Genius Guide to the Godling), the blood armor also gives you a +2 bonus to Will saves.
