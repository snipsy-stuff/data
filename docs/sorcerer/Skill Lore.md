### 📜 Description
You enhance a creature's knowledge about a particular skill. While the spell is in effect, the target gains an insight bonus equal to +1 per two caster levels (max +5) to one skill check chosen at the time of casting. If this skill check takes more than one round it gains no benefit from this spell. Only one skill lore can be in effect on a creature at a time as a second casting counters the first.
