### 📜 Description
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel shadow energy that grants 2d8 temporary hit points + 1 temporary hit point per caster level (maximum +10) though the target and those who observe him believe it has actually healed actual hit point damage. Your touch also casts a shadow over any feelings of irritation and rage the target feels. A target NPC who fail his save has his attitude improved by one-step (to a maximum of helpful). In addition, the target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against enchantment spells and effects cast by you for the duration of shadow healing. A successful save results in half healing (or damage if undead) and negates the improvement in attitude and the penalty to saving throws. This spell appears to outside observers and the target as cure moderate wounds, it also adds your caster level as an insight bonus to the Spellcraft DC; if a creature fails to identify the spell he falsely identifies it as cure moderate wounds.
