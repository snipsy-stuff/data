### 📜 Description
Bright red bursts flare from the body of the target summoned creature as you bend it to your will. To exert your influence over the creature, you must make a caster level check (DC equals 10 + 1/2 the caster level of the creature’s summoner + the level of the summon spell). If you beat the DC, the creature comes under your control as if you had cast the summon spell yourself. Henceforth, the creature acts on your turn each round. The summoned creature remains until the end of the original spell’s duration.

Eidolons, familiars, and the like do not qualify as summoned creatures for purpose of this spell (their bond to their master is too strong).
