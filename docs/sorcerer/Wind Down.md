### 📜 Description
You decrease the duration of one ongoing spell or spell-like ability that has been cast on a creature or object. You must make a level check, and if the check's total exceeds the target effect's spell level, its duration is reduced by half (minimum 1 round). If you are targeting a temporary effect from a magic item, use its level rather than the spell level for the level check.

A spell that is not subject to dispel magic is also not subject to wind down. The spell otherwise acts as dispel magic, but it cannot affect spells made permanent with permanency or magic items with no duration such as weapons, armor, or wands. However, wind down can affect ongoing spells and effects cast by magic items, schools, and potions.
