### 📜 Description
You create a tattoo upon your own body that has the ability to move and attack (using your base attack bonus plus the relevant casting ability modifier) out to a range equal to your natural reach. Moving the tattoo around your body is not an action. Attacking with the tattoo is a melee attack action (it can be used to make attacks of opportunity). The tattoo deals damage equal to 1d6 plus the relevant casting ability modifier (successfully disbelieving after interacting with the tattoo reduces the damage by half). The spell can create an animated tattoo of a lion roaring or a dragon breathing fire, a moving waterfall, or a warrior swinging a sword. The image and its movements are preset; once the spell is cast, you cannot change them. The tattoo can move all over your body if you wish.
