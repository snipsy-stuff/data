### 📜 Description
You gain a limited form of telepathy, which allows you to communicate with any lesser dragon within 100 ft., regardless of the creature's capability. Communicating with a companion dragon has an unlimited range with this spell as long as the creature is on the same plane. An unwilling dragon must succeed at a Will save to ignore your telepathic contact.

Converse with drake does not change the disposition of the creature contacted. Unpredictable or aggressive drakes may react strongly to intrusive thoughts, shifting their attitude down one step. A caster can attempt a Diplomacy check to alter attitudes as normal.
