### üìú Description
This spell transforms a volume of normal or magical water into an equal volume of highly corrosive acid. Any creature touching this acid suffers 1d6 points of damage per round of exposure except in the case of total immersion (such as in a vat of acid), which deals 10d6 points of damage per round. An attack with acid, such as from a hurled vial or a monster's spittle, counts as a round of exposure. The fumes from most acids are inhaled poisons. Those who are adjacent to a large body of acid must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves away from the acid. Creatures immune to acid's caustic properties might still drown in it if they are totally immersed (see Drowning in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game). If the acid is consumed, the victim takes 10d6 points of damage and must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 15 + your relevant ability score modifier) or take 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round for 6 rounds. Magical liquids (including potions) can be affected by this spell and lose their magical properties if transmuted. Potions and other magical waters receive a save against this spell's effect. Artifacts cannot be affected. This spell cannot be used to change water that a creature has already consumed or ingested. 

If targeted against a water-based creature (one with the water subtype), the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). A successful Fortitude save halves the damage. 

Only break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, polymorph any object, wish, or similar magic can restore waters transmuted by this spell.
