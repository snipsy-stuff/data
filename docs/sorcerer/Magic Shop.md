### 📜 Description
You conjure a sturdy merchant's shop made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the building resembles a merchant's shop, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a sign that depicts any simple image you designate.

The shop has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal building, and extreme heat adversely affects it and anyone inside. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise - it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants). 

The door and shutters are secure against intrusion, being arcane locked. In addition, these two areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shop. 

The magic shop contains simple furnishings - a countertop, display shelves, a workbench, two stools, and a writing desk.
