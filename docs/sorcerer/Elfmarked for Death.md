### 📜 Description
When you cast elfmarked for death, you fire a shimmering, translucent ray shaped like an arrow at any foe. This spell has particularly devastating effects against elves and the elfmarked, the natural enemies of the ancient tieflings who created it.

You may fire one ray every four levels (maximum five rays at 20th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 3d6 hp damage.

If a ray is fired at an elf, half-elf, or other character with the elf subtype, the ray deals 5d6 hp damage. If one or more elves are adjacent to a ray's target, regardless of whether the target is an elf, if the translucent arrow hits it splits into multiple rays and automatically strikes each elven foe, dealing 1d6 damage to each.

All rays must be aimed at targets within 30 ft. of each other and are fired simultaneously.
