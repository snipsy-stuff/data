### üìú Description
You bring forth a blazing ring of shimmering violet fire, one side of which (selected by you when you cast the spell) sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 points of fire damage to those between 10 and 20 feet. The ring deals 3d6 points of fire damage to any creature passing through it, dealing double damage to undead. You can make the ring opaque or translucent at the time you cast the spell, with an opaque ringblocking line of sight and a translucent ring providing partial concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance) when line of sight between two creatures passes through it. 

You set the ring's radius (with you at the center) at the time you cast the spell, and the ring moves as you move for as long as you concentrate on the spell. If you stop concentrating, the ring becomes immobile, though it continues to burn for a time. If you evoke the ring so it appears where creatures are, or if you move the ring so it passes through the squares they occupy, those creatures take damage as if passing through the ring. A creature takes damage from the ring a maximum of twice each round (once during your turn and once during its own turn). When a creature approaches and passes through the ring (or vice versa) the creature takes only the damage from passing through the ring.
