### 📜 Description
You generate a red and an orange prismatic ray in a 60-ft. line on the first round, and then yellow, green, indigo, and violet rays in the following rounds, provided you keep concentrating. You may target different creatures with the rays each round, but only one new color is generated each round. The different rays' effects are the same as described in prismatic spray.
