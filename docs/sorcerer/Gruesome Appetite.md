### 📜 Description
The creature you touch gains a bite attack, grab, and the swallow whole ability. A Small creature deals 1d4 points of damage with this bite, a Medium creature deals 1d6 points of damage, and a Large creature deals 1d8 points of damage. If the target already has a bite attack, use whichever damage is higher. The bite attack follows all rules for a natural weapon. The target also gains the grab and swallow whole abilities while using his bite (see Pathfinder Bestiary for additional details). For the purposes of this spell the CMB is equal to your caster level plus your relevant ability caster modifier or the subject creature's normal CMB, whichever is higher. If the target begins his turn with an opponent held in his mouth, he can attempt a new grapple check to swallow his prey. The opponent immediately takes bite damage, and every round thereafter takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage, and 1d6 points of acid damage from the target's digestive tract. The victim's equipment also suffers 1d6 acid damage per round. 

A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon, by dealing 20 points of damage against an AC of 10. Once the creature exits, the target's stomach muscles close the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The target of gruesome appetite may hold in his stomach one creature of equal size, two creatures of one size smaller, or four creatures of two or more sizes smaller. If this spell ends while a creature or its equipment is still in the target's stomach, the target regurgitates whatever he has swallowed into any adjacent square and is sickened for 1 round.
