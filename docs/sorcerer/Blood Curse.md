### 📜 Description
With this spell, you cause a target creature's blood to thin and its heart to beat faster, increasing blood flow - and with it, the amount of damage dealt by wounds. A target under the effects of this spell suffers double damage from all slashing or piercing attacks and double damage from bleed effects (such as those suffered by a dying character). This increased damage stacks with any damage done by a critical hit. This spell does not affect creatures with the construct, elemental, plant, ooze, or undead creature type. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
