### üìú Description
This spell creates a solid wall of very strong, interlocking bones, 1 inch thick per caster level.

It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level. Thus, a 10th-level caster can create a wall 100 feet long and 10 feeet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet.

The wall can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting surface must be anchored on two opposite sides. The wall cannot be conjured to occupy the same space as a creature or another object.

A wall of bones can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 6 and 10 hp per inch of thickness.

A section of the wall is breached when its hit points drop to 0. If a creature tries to smash through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
