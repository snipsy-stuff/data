### üìú Description
The target‚Äôs body becomes wholly transparent, gaining a +40 bonus to Stealth checks while motionless, +20 while moving. If the target is perfectly still, it gains total concealment until the beginning of its next turn. This requires remaining motionless, taking no actions which require; or physical movement, though slight movements such as breathing and speaking (including casting spells without somatic components) do not break this total concealment. If the target moves or attacks, it does not become visible but gains concealment rather than total concealment until the beginning of its next turn as blurred flickers of movement betray its presence.

Unlike invisibility, this spell affects only the target‚Äôs body, not his armor, clothing, weapons, or any other items worn or carried. If the target wears or carries an object, he gains only concealment (rather than total concealment) even if stationary, his location can be pinpointed automatically, and the Stealth bonus provided by the spell is halved. This is also true if the target catches on fire or has an object attached to them involuntarily, such as a tanglefoot bag or manacles. The target‚Äôs blood is transparent, so wounds and blood do not reveal his position, though the target‚Äôs blood that falls upon the ground or adjacent objects becomes visible 1 minute after it is shed. If the target is within the area of natural or magical fog, mist, or precipitation, clinging condensation reveals his location as a carried object.

This spell is a polymorph effect, not an illusion; hence, a creature affected by simple transparency cannot be seen with see invisibility nor revealed by invisibility purge or any other effect that detects, dispels, or suppresses illusions or invisibility effects (though it can be outlined and revealed by dust of appearance, faerie fire, and glitterdust). True seeing also reveals the target‚Äôs true (visible) form. This spell cannot be used in conjunction with other polymorph effects.

Each time a creature uses this spell, there is a 1% cumulative chance its effects become permanent. Permanent simple transparency is treated as a curse effect and cannot be dispelled unless a successful remove curse is first used, though break enchantment can remove it. Restoring the target to their normal state does not reduce this chance if this spell is used again in the future. In addition, once this curse effect has manifested, any time the target uses any invisibility effect she may once again become afflicted with permanent simple transparency when that effect expires. Only a limited wish, miracle, or wish can reduce this chance to zero. Every 24 hours a creature spends permanently transparent causes her to gain 1 Madness point (DC 13 Will save negates; the DC increases by 1 for each day after the first).
