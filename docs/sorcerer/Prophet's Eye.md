### 📜 Description
You gain an immediate insight into the target's bodily experiences. You see what she sees, experience what she experiences, hear what she hears and even taste what she tastes for the duration of the spell. You do not take damage if the target takes damage, nor do you heal damage if the target heals. An unwilling target that fails the saving throw knows only that some sort of magic has passed through her, not what it was. If the target creature begins to do or say something that would normally be kept secret she is allowed a second Will save; if this save is successful, she gets an uneasy feeling that someone is watching her but no idea who or how.

During the duration of the spell, you see what the target sees in addition to what your normally see. This overlapping of images and sounds can make it very difficult to perform complex tasks giving you a -4 circumstance penalty on all skill checks and forcing a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.
