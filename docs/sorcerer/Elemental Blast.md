### 📜 Description
Elemental energy erupts from your hand and extends outward in a cone. Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The elemental blast causes 6d6 hp damage +1 hp per level of that energy type to all creatures in the cone. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.

An elemental blast also has a special effect based on its energy type, described below.

Acid: Your elemental blast causes 1d6 hp acid damage for the next 2d6 rounds. Those affected must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for the duration of the ongoing acid damage.

Cold: Creatures taking damage become fatigued (or exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a previous elemental blast) for 2d6 rounds.
Electricity: Creatures taking damage are staggered for 2d6 rounds.

Fire: Your elemental blast causes 1d6 hp fire damage for the next 2d6 rounds. Those affected can use a full-round action to extinguish the flames and negate this additional damage.

When you cast this spell to deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, it is a spell of that type.
