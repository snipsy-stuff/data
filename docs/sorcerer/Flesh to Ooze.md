### 📜 Description
This spell functions like baleful polymorph, except the target becomes an ooze of its size. A creature of 3 HD or less becomes a gray ooze, 4-9 HD becomes a gelatinous cube or ochre jelly, and 10+ HD becomes a black pudding. Alternatively, instead of a creature you may target a quantity of inert flesh (such as that created by the stone to flesh spell or a dead body) of sufficient mass, which becomes an ooze of your choice.

If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, an Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hp). It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities.

Because a target's gear does not transform with it, any items fall under or within the ooze's body, which may mean the items are destroyed. If the ooze has the split ability, splitting the ooze creates one ooze that retains the creature's original identity (for the purpose of memories or restoring the creature) and one normal mindless ooze of that type.
