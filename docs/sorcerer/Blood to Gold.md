### 📜 Description
This spell transforms the blood of a living creature (one that has blood) to molten gold (10 gp worth). The target creature suffers 2 points of Constitution damage and 4d6 fire damage per round. A heal spell cast during this time saves the creature's life, healing the damage and negating the spell. Creatures successful in their saving throws suffer only 4d6 points of fire damage and the spell ends.
