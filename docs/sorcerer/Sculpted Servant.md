### 📜 Description
You imbue a Diminutive (1 ft. tall or smaller) humanoid figurine with mobility and a semblance of life. The servant can fetch things, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can only open normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like.

Despite its size, it has an effective Strength score of 6 (so it can lift 60 lbs. or drag 300 lbs). It can trigger traps and similar devices, but it can exert only 60 lbs. of force. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. The servant cannot fly, climb, or swim (though wooden servants may float), but it can levitate up to 5 ft. in the air as a standard action. Its base speed is 20 ft. It can be instructed to run or hustle, but it stops before it would take any nonlethal damage. The servant cannot undertake a forced march.

The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. However, if the servant takes 15 or more hp damage, it explodes, dealing 1d6 hp damage per 2 levels in a 5-ft.-radius burst centered on the servant. Anyone in the area of effect can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.
