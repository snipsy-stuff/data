### 📜 Description
You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape a quasi-real illusion of your dead body and then cloak yourself as undetectable. This spell discharges only when an effect would result in your having the Dead condition. It negates that effect and creates a perfect illusion of your death that matches the normal results of that effect; it also leaves a greater shadow conjuration of your remains. It takes a successful disbelief, requiring interaction with the remains (Will save) to realize they are an illusion. The spell renders you invisible (as greater invisibility) and inaudible, you are also undetectable by blindsense, blindsight, lifesense, scent and tremorsense, it also grants pass without trace and the ability to shadow walk (as per those spells) for 1 round per level. 

This spell can only negate an effect that would result in your death or destruction once a day. Also, effects such as petrification, trap the soul, or being polymorphed into a music box playing your opponent's theme song are not negated since they do not result in the dead condition. Creatures that cannot die gain no benefits from this spell.
