### 📜 Description
You momentarily become a shadow, able to slide under a door, through a keyhole, or any other tiny opening. All of your equipment is transformed with you, and you can move up to your full running speed during the spell's duration.

If you return to your normal size while in a space too small for you (such as a mouse hole, sewer pipe, or the like), you suffer 3d6 hp damage while creating a space just big enough to fit into. You can cast spells without somatic components, and you can speak and breathe while in such a space. If the duration ends with you within a keyhole or door, it breaks and you take damage equal to the object's hardness.
