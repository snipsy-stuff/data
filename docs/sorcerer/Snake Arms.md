### 📜 Description
You transform two of your arms into slithering snakes. You control these snakes and may use them to bite your opponents. When using the snake arms, your natural reach increases by 5 ft. You make attacks with the snake arms with an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier plus an enhancement bonus equal to one-fourth your caster level (maximum +5). A successful hit with a snake bite deals 1d6 points of damage plus your relevant caster ability modifier plus its enhancement bonus, plus poison.

Poison (Ex) Bite - injury; save Fort DC (10 + 1/2 your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier); frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Attacking with the snakes is a similar to attacking with natural weapons. You can attack with one snakehead as a standard action, or you can make multiple attacks, using the snakeheads as part of a full attack action. You cannot wield weapons while under the effects of the spell, though you can use other natural attacks (such as a bite or a monk's unarmed attacks) if you possess these. 

The snake arms are much more unwieldy than normal hands, and while you can use the snakes' mouths to grasp objects; you lose any sense of fine motor control. You suffer a -4 circumstance penalty to any skills that involve digital precision.
