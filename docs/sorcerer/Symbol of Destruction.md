### 📜 Description
This spell functions like symbol of death, except a symbol of destruction slays each creature within its radius suffers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 10d6 points of damage but are immune to the effects of this symbol for 24 hours. If the spell slays the target, it consumes the remains utterly in holy (or unholy) fire (but not its equipment or possessions). 

The only way to restore life to a character who has failed to save against this spell (and was slain) is to use true resurrection, miracle, or a carefully worded wish spell followed by resurrection. Once triggered, the symbol of destruction remains active until it affects creatures whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 200, or for 10 minutes per level, whichever comes first.

Magic traps such as symbol of destruction are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of destruction and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 for symbol of destruction.
