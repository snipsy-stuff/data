### 📜 Description
Your words cause your targets' faces to twist and contort as they turn to vent their wrath on their allies. You force the targets to attack their nearest ally. This attack can be of any sort, but it must be an attack that, to the creature's knowledge, deals damage and is the most effective form of attack in the target's arsenal. If the creature has no ally, or if all its allies are out of attack range, it takes no actions but defends itself normally.
