### 📜 Description
You charm the target, convincing him that you are a good friend and trusted ally. If the target is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, he receives a +5 bonus on his saving throw. The spell does not enable you to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but the target perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the target orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything one wouldn't ordinarily do (retries not allowed.) A charmed creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threaten the charmed creature breaks the spell. Note also that you must speak the creature's language to communicate commands, or else be good at pantomiming. Once affected, it does not matter how far the target moves from the caster.
