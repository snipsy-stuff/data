### 📜 Description
When the victims of troglodyte's curse are angry or frightened, including any combat situation, they secrete an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every form of life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes, but not those affected by this spell) within 30 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the original spell), or be sickened for 10 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same victim's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. 

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, delay poison, limited wish, miracle, neutralize poison, remove curse, or wish spell.
