### 📜 Description
This spell allows you to select a specific creature type and/or subtype, for example a humanoid with a subtype such as human, dwarf, halfling, or goblinoid, or just a type, such as dragon, giant, or fey. Within the bounds of the spell, only creatures of the specified type and or subtype can take actions. All other creatures remain frozen within an energy field - held in a temporal stasis that does not allow them to be harmed or affected in any way. 

The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. Only creatures of the chosen type can be within the structure at the time of casting. Creatures of the non-chosen type and/or subtype that come with 100 feet of the area know they will be temporally imprisoned if they enter the area affect.
