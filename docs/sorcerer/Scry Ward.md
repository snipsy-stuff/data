### 📜 Description
You scatter fragments of a broken mirror over the target creatures and as you speak and gesture, the pieces flare with lime light when they touch the creatures and then melt away. All attempts to scry the warded creatures automatically fail, revealing nothing. In addition, anyone who attempts to scry the warded creatures is immediately attacked by creatures from a summon monster VI. They hunt down and attack the creature responsible for the scrying until the spell ends, they lose the trail, they are dispelled, destroyed, or the quarry is killed or destroyed.
