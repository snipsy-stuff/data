### 📜 Description
You perform a ritual that marks one unattended magic item (including weapons and armor) with a clearly visible stain of your blood. The exact appearance of the bloodstain is up to you, but the magic item's abilities do not function for anyone else as long as the bloodstain remains on it.

For example, a +1 flaming kukri with a vital mark is a non-magical kukri in anyone's hands. It only functions as a +1 flaming weapon for the caster who placed the bloodstain upon it.

This spell can be made permanent with the permanency spell for a cost of 5,000 gp and minimum level 10th.

A vital mark can be removed with spells such as dispel magic.
