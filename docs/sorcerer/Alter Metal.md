### üìú Description
This spell transmutes one kind of metal into another. The metal you affect (both in its original and transmuted forms) must be solid at room temperature (so that neither mercury nor molten iron can be altered, for example). You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum weight is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater weight than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 9th-level caster (9 lb. maximum) could transmute 450 coins in a pile of 500, but could not affect 9 lb. of metal in a 10-lb. ingot.

This spell can transmute any type of mundane metal or alloy (including brass, lead, bronze, iron, copper, and silver) but cannot affect or create gold, platinum, adamantine, mithral, alchemical silver, or cold iron.

Weapons and armor become less effective if transmuted into softer metal (steel to copper, for example), with weapons taking a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls and armor losing 1 point of armor bonus. Weapons softened by this spell bend and gain the Broken condition on any attack roll of 1. Armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck by a natural attack roll of 20, upon reaching an armor bonus of zero it gains the Broken condition.

Unattended, nonmagical items receive no saving throw against this spell, while nonmagical items in a creature's possession use the wielder's Will save bonus. Magic items use their own Will save bonus or their wielder's, whichever is higher. Metal creatures and intelligent metal magic items are not affected by this spell.

A successful Appraise or Spellcraft check (DC 15) reveals this spell's effect on an item.
