### üìú Description
When you cast this spell, a globe of crackling electricity surrounds you. The inside of the sphere is hollow (there is no electricity inside), so only those creatures within five feet of the edge risk damage from the sphere. Touching the wall of the sphere deals 8d6 points of electrical damage. Those creatures that would be caught by the edge of the sphere when it is created, or those that would be in its path when the sphere is moved (see below) are entitled to a Reflex save to negate this damage. Creatures that voluntarily pass through the sphere receive no saving throw. 

The electricity making up the sphere makes it hard to see targets on the other side. Opponents on opposite sides of the sphere gain concealment from each other (20% miss chance). 

You may move the sphere, by moving yourself, but doing so is a taxing process. Moving the sphere requires a full-round action and requires a successful Concentration check (DC 28). If the check fails, the spell ends. If the check succeeds, you may move up to your normal movement. The sphere travels with you, keeping you at its center. Any creatures caught in the path of the sphere must make a Reflex save or take damage as described above. While the spell is in effect, you cannot move unless you move the sphere with you. 

Additionally, as a standard action, you can channel a small fragment of the spell into a bolt of lightning. You can strike one creature within a range of 100 feet plus 10 feet per caster level. The bolt deals 3d6 points of electrical damage if the creature is outside of the sphere or 6d6 points of electrical damage if the creature is inside the sphere. The bolts automatically hit, but the target may make a Reflex save for half damage.
