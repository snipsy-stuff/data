### 📜 Description
Your mouth and lungs fill with a foul-tasting fluid so when you speak or exhale, a fine green mist leaks from your nose and mouth. After casting this spell, you gain a supernatural toxic breath weapon; you may activate this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action.

Breath Weapon (Su): 60-ft. cone, DC as per the spell, instantaneously deal 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (a successful Reflex save halves the damage), it also deals 1d3 points of poison damage for 6 rounds to the ability score of your choice (you must choose at the time of using the breath weapon); three successive Fortitude saves are required to negate the effects of the poison.
