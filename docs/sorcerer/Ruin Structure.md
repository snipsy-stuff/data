### 📜 Description
Crumble causes the bonds holding nonliving matter to break apart, ruining them, and leaving only a pile of debris. If the objects in question succeed on a Fortitude save, they object is reduced to half its normal hit points total and gains the broken condition, further successful saves have no effect. If the target is large enough that it has multiple zones of hit points (such as a wall having hit points for every five-foot section) each area is subject to the effect. 

If the surface below a character is destroyed, the creature takes falling damage as normal (1d6 points per 10 feet; a successful Acrobatics check can reduce the damage). 

If a structure such as a building is ruined while occupied, those inside it may be trapped and take damage. A character inside a heavy structure, such as a multi-level wooden structure or a stone structure takes 9d6 points of damage from falling debris and is buried (see below). A successful Reflex save reduces damage by half. Any character inside a light structure, such as a single-level wooden structure takes 3d6 points of damage (Reflex save for half) and is only buried on a failed Reflex save. Also, characters standing near a heavy structure (within 5 ft. per 15. ft. of height) take 3d6 points of damage from falling debris (Reflex save for half). Very light structures, such as canvas tents, do not pose a substantial risk to their occupants.
