### 📜 Description
This spell functions as elemental body I, but the recipient may polymorph only into an earth or water elemental. Her form becomes partially amorphous, granting 25% immunity to critical hits, sneak attacks, and similar precision-based damage; this overlaps and does not stack with similar effects, such as fortification armor.
