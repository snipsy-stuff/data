### 📜 Description
You harness an eldritch power and project it into a cloud of blood red, hazy vampiric mist.

In addition to obscuring sight in the same way as fog cloud, the fog deals 2 points of Constitution drain and sickens creatures within it each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell. If a creature is reduced to 0 Constitution points, it dies.

Creatures that move out of the fog's area of effect are sickened for the following 2d6 rounds.
