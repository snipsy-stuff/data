### 📜 Description
This spell pushes your target through a dimensional portal, causing it to reappear a short distance away. You must make a successful melee touch attack to use this spell. If the target fails its Will save, it disappears from its current location and reappears 10 ft. away from you per caster level (maximum 100 ft.). It appears in a location directly away from you. This travel can take it through walls, creatures, or other solid surfaces, but if the distance traveled would place the creature inside a solid object, it instead appears in the nearest open square in the path of travel.
