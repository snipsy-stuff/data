### 📜 Description
An urchin-shaped missile made from the black stuff of the Dark Tapestry flies from your fingers, deals 1d3+1 hp cold damage, and may fatigue the target.

For every two levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile-two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures, and each missile has the possibility of fatiguing the target (although a creature hit with multiple missiles is only subject to one chance of being fatigued for 1 round). A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.
