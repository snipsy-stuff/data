### 📜 Description
A globe of water moves and rolls in a direction of your choice at a speed of up to 30 ft./round. As part of this movement, it can climb or jump up to 30 ft. to strike an object. It quenches fires and can entangle one creature of Medium sized or smaller.

When the sphere enters the space of a target, it can be avoided with a successful Reflex save. On a failed save, the target is entangled by the sphere; it is immediately considered submerged and must hold its breath to avoid drowning if it cannot breathe water. Once the watery sphere has entangled a creature, it moves with them. The entangled creature can attempt to break free of the sphere as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check with a DC to escape equal to the DC of the spell.

A creature breaking free of the globe ends the spell.
