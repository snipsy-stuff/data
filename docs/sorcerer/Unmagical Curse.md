### üìú Description
You cut off a creature from all magic; magical effects that would affect the subject (including enhancement bonuses to attack or damage the subject) are suppressed as if the subject were in an antimagic field. Magical items do not function for the caster, creatures lose all spell casting abilities, their supernatural abilities do not function, nor do their spell-like abilities (see below for certain spells and effects to which this does not apply). If you wield or are considered to be attending an item that is subject to this spell you are automatically subject to this spell so long as you are attending the item. This spell can be beneficial as your mundane and extraordinary abilities would ignore any magical defenses (though your ranged attacks would not since you are no longer attending the ammunition). The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, wish, or miracle. Remove curse only grants the victim a second saving throw; if this second save is failed, the spell has no further effect. The spells listed above when being used to remove this curse are not suppressed by unmagical curse, this allows for a subject of the spell to remove the spell by casting remove curse on herself.
