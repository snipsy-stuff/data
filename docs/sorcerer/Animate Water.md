### 📜 Description
The volume of water affected determines the possible sizes of the creature you create. You can animate a larger amount of water based on the following: A Medium creation counts as two Small or smaller creatures; a Large creation as four; a Huge creation as eight; a Gargantuan creation as 16; and a Colossal creation as 32. You can change the size and number of the creations as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

The creations have the statistics of animated objects as described in the Pathfinder Bestiary  with the following difference: Instead of hardness the animated water has DR 10/magic and takes half damage from piercing and slashing weapons. This spell cannot affect any liquids carried by a creature.

Animate water can be made permanent with a permanency spell at a cost of 17,500 gp.
