### 📜 Description
A much more potent spell than animate dead, this evil spell allows you to infuse a dead body with negative energy to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). The type or types of undead you can create are based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.

Caster Level - Undead Created
11th or lower - Ghoul
12th-14th - Ghast
15th-17th - Mummy
18th or higher - Mohrg

You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.

This spell must be cast at night.
