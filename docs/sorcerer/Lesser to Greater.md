### 📜 Description
This spell causes a lesser dragon to take on the form of one of its larger cousins. This effect operates in the same manner as form of the dragon I, except the creature must have some aspect in common with the dragon whose form it will take (shared breath weapon, environment, or elemental subtype). For a sorcerer or wizard able to cast 6th level spells, this spell operates as form of the dragon II, and for those who can cast 7th level spells, it operates as form of the dragon III.
