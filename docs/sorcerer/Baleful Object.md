### üìú Description
The target object you touch flares with sickening green light until suddenly the unhealthy glow fades. You magically bind a curse (a spell that cannot be dispelled, such as bestow curse) to the object touched. An unwilling creature attending an object you wish to affect with this spell receives a Will save to negate this spell. When a creature is considered to be attending the object (touching it or carrying on one's person) that creature is subject to the curse. Baleful object attempts to dispel (as described in greater dispel magic) any and all spells, spell-like abilities or effects on the target that directly or indirectly interfere with the curse taking effect. For example, a character casts bestow curse onto a longsword and a subject with spell immunity (bestow curse) upon her touches the object. A dispel check is made (DC 11 + the caster level of the spell immunity). If the dispel succeeds, the spell is dispelled before the bestow curse takes effect. Baleful object's dispelling can only affect spells cast upon a creature or object. Independent spell effects or those affecting an area cannot be dispelled, even if they prevent the curse from affecting the attending creature.

Baleful object can dispel spells and magic items specifically intended to foil the spell in question (spell immunity), that provide general protection from spells (spell resistance), and/or offer any bonuses to the saving throws (cloak of resistance). You make a check for each instance of protection; a magic item so affected is suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds.

You are not affected by the cursed object when you cast the spell but any time you touch or attend the object after the initial casting, you are affected as normal.
