### 📜 Description
You enchant the target fire source, causing it to waver and swim in enchanting patterns that entrance creatures able to see the flames. This affects targets as enthrall, but rather than paying attention to you and your speaking or singing their attention is fixated upon the target fire source. Fire charm requires no further action by you after casting to continue fascinating the creatures involved, and you can leave the area of effect without disrupting their attention upon the fire. However, the reactions of enraptured creatures toward you functions as normal for enthrall if you do communicate with them. In addition, the rippling patterns of the fire charm distract and unravel the willpower of entranced creatures, causing them to take a -4 penalty to Will saves and Wisdom checks (including Wisdom-based skill checks).

If the fire source is extinguished, the spell ends but creatures spend 1d3 rounds recovering from their trance (as enthrall). If the fire is not extinguished but their line of sight to it is interrupted, affected creatures will spend 1d3 rounds moving to find a better view of the fire charm. If after this time they still have no line of sight to the fire, their trance ends.

If the target fire source is Small or smaller, it can entrance creatures within 20 feet. For every size category of the target fire larger than Small, this range is increased by 20 feet, up to 120 feet for a Colossal fire.

A fire charm can entrance vermin even though it is a mind-affecting effect.
