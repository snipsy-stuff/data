### 📜 Description
Cursed gift imbues an object with a curse or another, unwanted harmful magical effect from which the caster or a touched creature currently suffers. If transferring an unwanted magical effect from a creature, the creature must be touched immediately before the caster touches the item that is to be imbued with that effect.

If an item cursed in this way is given to someone who freely accepts it during the duration of the spell, the curse temporarily transfers to the item's recipient. A successful Will save negates this effect.

If the item's recipient fails this Will save, the curse's original target no longer suffers from their affliction for the duration of this spell. Instead, the curse affects the item's recipient as normal. Returning or giving away the cursed item has no effect on a creature that has received a curse in this manner, nor does breaking the curse on the spell's original target.

This spell can also be cast on a cursed object, allowing the owner to be rid of it if someone else freely accepts it as a gift.
