### üìú Description
An invisible harmonic vibration emanates from you when you cast this spell. The emanation protects you from a spell school of your choice, impeding all spells and spell-like abilities of the selected school. To target you (or the area in which you reside) with a spell from the impeded school, the caster must make a Spellcraft check (DC 11 + your caster level). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Against pre-existing continuous spells in the area of effect, impede magic functions like dispel magic. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against each ongoing spell currently in the area of effect. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. Regardless of whether you fail a check or not, make dispel checks against every ongoing spell in the area of impede magic. Magic items are not affected. If you selected conjuration as the impeded school, existing summoned monsters are subject to the dispel check. You may choose to succeed automatically on dispel checks against a spell you cast.
