### 📜 Description
By touching the skull and speaking the magic words, you enchant a skull so you can see through its eye sockets. The skull's range of sight is the same as your normal vision (and darkvision, up to 60 ft.). You can also see through your own eyes regularly, but you have merely to concentrate to focus on either one. If the caster leaves the skull behind, he can move up to 1 mile away per level. If he moves beyond that range, the spell ends. Also if the skull is broken, the spell ends.
