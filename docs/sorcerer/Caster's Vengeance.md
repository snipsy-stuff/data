### 📜 Description
Any creature that attacks you suffers magical feedback that inflicts 2d6 points of force energy damage + 1 point per caster level. For the purposes of this spell, an attack is any action that requires an attack roll, whether or not the attack succeeds. If you willingly allow someone to touch you (such as a cleric casting a curative spell), no attack roll is needed, and thus the action does not trigger this spell's effect. In addition, any creature against which you make a successful melee touch attack also suffers the damage.
