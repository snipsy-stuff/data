### üìú Description
You create a razor-sharp scythe of pure force. This scythe attacks the opponent you desire, once per round starting on the round you cast the spell. The scythe has a total attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier with a +5 enhancement bonus. Because it is a force effect, the scythe can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. The scythe deals 9d6+5 plus your relevant caster ability modifier points of damage on a successful attack and has a threat range of 19-20 and a critical modifier of x4. 

Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the scythe severs the opponent's head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. After severing a head the spell is discharged. The scythe occupies a square just as a creature would and threatens an area five feet in each direction. 

The scythe can take attacks of opportunity, but only one per round (even if the caster could take more). The scythe is capable of flanking opponents, but normally requires specific instructions to do so. If left on its own, the scythe will move to its target in the most direct path possible and attack it. If the target moves out of range, the scythe will hover at the edge of the range and resume its attack should the target return. 

As a standard action, once each round after the first, you can designate a new target for the scythe, or give it a more complex attack order, such as making it flank the target. It cannot at any time have more than one target. 

The scythe is immune to physical attacks but can be affected by dispel magic, disintegrate, a rod of cancellation or similar effects. For the purpose of touch attacks, the scythe has an AC of 16 (+1 size, +5 deflection).

If the scythe's target has spell resistance, make the check the first time the scythe attacks. If the target fails to resist, the scythe affects it normally for the duration of the spell. If the target resists, the scythe cannot affect that target, but it is not dispelled and the caster can designate a new target next round. Once a creature has made a resistance check, the result is used for the duration of the spell, even if the scythe is changed from the target and then back to it again.
