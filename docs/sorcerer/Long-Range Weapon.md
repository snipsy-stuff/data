### 📜 Description
By casting this spell, you increase the range increment of one or more thrown weapons or projectiles by +50%. For example, a javelin (range increment of 30 feet) has a range increment of 45 feet while under the effects of this spell, while an arrow fired from a shortbow (normal range increment 60 feet) increases its range increment to 90 feet. The effects of this spell for each particular weapon end the first time it's thrown or fired (even if it doesn't break), and long-range weapon doesn't stack with any other range increase, magical or otherwise.
