### 📜 Description
You drive out all of the air in a target’s lungs, causing her to suffocate. If the target fails her save, she is stunned for 1 round and then falls unconscious (0 hit points) at the start of her next turn. In the following round, and each round thereafter, the target is entitled to another save. On a failure, the target takes 1 point of damage. The spell ends immediately as soon as the target makes a Fortitude save.

If the target makes her initial save against strangle, she takes 4d6 points of nonlethal damage but is otherwise unaffected.
