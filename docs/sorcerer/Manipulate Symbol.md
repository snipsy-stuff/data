### 📜 Description
While under the effect of this spell, you cannot trigger a single symbol spell, which must be designated when you cast manipulate symbol. This effect lasts for 1 round per level.

With a successful level check against the level of the symbol's creator, you can alter the symbol spell into any other symbol you can cast. You also may change how and when the symbol is triggered. You must touch the symbol to alter it. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check.

If you fail to manipulate the symbol, you trigger it instead.
