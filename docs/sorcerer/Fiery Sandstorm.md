### 📜 Description
The caster generates a furious sandstorm, with massive wind speeds, that is laced with punishing flames. For every turn that a creature is in the area of effect, it takes 2d6 hp bludgeoning damage for every four levels (Reflex save for half) and 1d6 hp fire damage for every 4 levels every round (no saving throw).

Natural flying is impossible, but magical flight (such as levitation) is still possible. Note that if any spellcasters are within the area of effect, they must make a DC 25 concentration check first to attempt spellcasting.
