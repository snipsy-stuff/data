### 📜 Description
This spell fires one or more Small or smaller creatures as if from a catapult. The fired creature is immediately given a free movement and charge attack. If the catapulted creature fails a DC 15 Acrobatics check, it falls prone before it can attack and loses the +2 to attack due to charge, but it still receives the free move action (meaning it can stand up).
