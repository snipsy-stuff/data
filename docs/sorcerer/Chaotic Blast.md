### üìú Description
You release a chaotic blast of power to attack your foes. The range, shape, substance, and damage are all random, so your attack might be a flaming cone of feathers, a ray of spurting water, a burst of kittens (which vanish moments after the spell's completion), or any other of thousands of possibilities. First, roll to determine the area of effect. After determining the area of effect, choose the target(s). After choosing your target(s), roll to determine damage dealt and then the substance the chaos blast consists of. If the substance includes a descriptor, such as [fire], the damage is of that type. Otherwise, it is considered bludgeoning damage. Roll once for each attribute (once for area of effect, once for damage, once for substance). All results dependent on level can go no higher than if the spell had been cast by a 10th level caster (if the spell deals 1d4 damage/level, even a 20th level caster will only deal 10d4 damage). All matter created by this spell disappears at the beginning of your next round.

If chaotic blast deals damage, the save is Reflex-based, and the duration is instantaneous unless otherwise stated. If chaotic blast instead has a spell effect, use the saving throw and duration of that spell.

Spells simulated by chaotic blast affect all creatures and/or objects in the area of effect. Metamagic feats and other abilities that alter the composition or area of a spell have no effect on chaotic blast. This spell is known by many as hail of inappropriate objects.
