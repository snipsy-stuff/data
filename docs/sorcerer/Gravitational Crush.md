### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, you increase the gravitational forces in an area so much that creatures risk being crushed under their own weight. Each round that a creature remains within the area of the spell, it must make a Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of damage +1 point of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). Further, all creatures (regardless of whether they saved) suffer a -10 penalty to Strength while in the area of the spell and can only move at half speed. Creatures that fly must make a DC 20 Strength check in order to remain aloft.
