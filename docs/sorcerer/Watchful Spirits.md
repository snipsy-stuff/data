### 📜 Description
Opponents gain no bonus from flanking you, as if you had the improved uncanny dodge ability (see the barbarian class feature in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game; use your caster level in place of barbarian levels for the purpose of determining whether a rogue can sneak attack you). 

In addition, while this spell is in effect, you add your caster level as an insight bonus on any one Reflex save. Using this function is an immediate action and must be declared before the save is rolled. Using this ability discharges the spell.
