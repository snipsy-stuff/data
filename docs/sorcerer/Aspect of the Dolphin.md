### 📜 Description
You imbue yourself with the speed and hydrodynamics of a dolphin. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed (including the +8 bonus to Swim checks granted to all creatures with a swim speed). You can choose to take 10 on a Swim check even if you are endangered or distracted. This spell grants no ability to breathe water but doubles the duration you can hold your breath.
