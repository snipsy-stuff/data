### 📜 Description
This spell creates a mark of a red and blue colored eye on the forehead (or other prominent feature) of any creature, living or undead. Those bearing this mark gain a +5 insight bonus to a single skill chosen at the time of casting. They also possess the ability to grant themselves a single +25 insight boost to one skill check roll (the same skill chosen at the time of casting). Using this boost ability is an immediate action that instantly dismisses the greater mark of secrets. You cannot possess more than one greater mark of secrets at a time.
