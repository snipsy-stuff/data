### 📜 Description
You invoke the mystical power of the red dragon to transform a creature into a red dragon (as form of the dragon I) and to drive the target into a mad, bestial frenzy. For the remainder of the spell's duration, the target behaves as if under a rage spell and attacks the nearest creature with its natural weapons or breath weapon in preference to other actions. Also for the duration, if it is attacked, it automatically attacks its closest attacker(s) on its next turn. Once the spell ends, the target is dazed for 1 round as it returns to its normal state.
