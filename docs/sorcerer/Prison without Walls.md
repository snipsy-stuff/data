### 📜 Description
With a series of sweeping arm gestures, you attempt an incorporeal ranged touch attack (although you do not become incorporeal) to tether a target to a fixed object in hyperdimensional space. Your incorporeal ranged touch attack ignores the target's cover bonuses, shield, natural armor, and most armor, but it does not ignore armor bonuses granted by force effects such as mage armor, bracers of armor, and elf lord's battle armor 

While tethered, the target cannot move farther than 100 ft. minus 5 ft. per level (minimum 5 ft.) from its current position. Since the tether exists entirely in another dimension, the target cannot sever it directly. However, a successful DC 23 Escape Artist check, a successful DC 23 Strength check, or any form of dimensional travel frees it.
