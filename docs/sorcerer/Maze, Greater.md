### 📜 Description
This spell functions as maze, but the target takes 4d6 hp damage each round it is within the maze, as traps and other hazards constantly attack it. The target can make a Reflex saving throw each round to halve the damage. Escaping the maze is more difficult as well, requiring the target to make 2 consecutive DC 20 Intelligence checks. Finally, the spell's duration is increased to 1 minute per level if the target does not escape through other means.
