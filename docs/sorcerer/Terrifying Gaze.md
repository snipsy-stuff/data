### üìú Description
Your eyes flash brightly with the power and presence of dragonkind, granting you a gaze attack. Enemies within 30 ft. of you that meet your gaze must succeed on a Will save or become shaken for the duration of the spell. Shaken targets become panicked for 2d4 rounds and remain shaken for the remainder of the spell's duration. A creature that succeeds on a Will save is shaken for that round but is immune to this gaze attack for 24 hours

A target may avoid this gaze attack by averting its eyes, gaining a 50% chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against the gaze attack (it also gains a 20% miss chance on attacks against you). A target may also otherwise take action to avoid looking at you (for example, using a blindfold, which gives you total concealment against it).

Dragons receive a +2 bonus to the DC of this spell. Dragonkin, draconic bloodline sorcerers, and wizards who specialize in the dragon arcane school receive a +1 bonus to the DC of this spell. These bonuses do not stack.
