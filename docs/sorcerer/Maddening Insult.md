### üìú Description
The target creature is afflicted with an uncontrollable anger, taking a -2 penalty to Armor Class and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. Starting with the target's first action after the spell has been cast, it tries to attack you, disregarding any ranged attacks available to it in order to attack with a melee weapon. The subject makes up to a double move toward you (charging if possible), and while it won't move into obvious hazards trying to reach you, it may rush across hidden dangers (such as covered pits or quicksand), even as it ignores attacks from other creatures. 

If the target gets within melee reach of you, it attacks you to the exclusion of all other foes until the spell ends or it kills you. 

When attacking, the subject uses the most potent melee attack or attacks it has available (subject to the limitations below). If unable to reach or attack you, the subject tries to position itself for melee attacks against you for 1d4 rounds before turning and attacking the nearest creature. Once it chooses a creature to attack, it attacks that creature to the exclusion of all others. 

While the spell is in effect, the target creature cannot use Concentration or any Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence based skills (except for Acrobatics, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), nor can it use any abilities requiring patience or concentration. The target creature cannot cast spells or activate command-word, spell-trigger, or spell-completion magic items, nor can it use Combat Expertise or any item creation or metamagic feat. 

Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower are not affected by this spell.
