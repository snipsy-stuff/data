### 📜 Description
The subject of this spell becomes easily noticed (-20 to Stealth checks). People meeting him will unconsciously remember everything about him. When interrogated, anyone who met the subject of the spell must make a Will save against the spell or be unable to hold anything back from the interrogation. If they make the save, normal Diplomacy and Intimidation DCs apply. Friends of the subject may notice that he is doing small things to make himself noticed if they make a Sense Motive check against a DC of 25. If they point this out to him, he gets one additional saving throw against this spell.
