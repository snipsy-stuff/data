### 📜 Description
Immediately upon casting this spell, and once per round thereafter, you may shoot a 10-ft.-long line of boiling-hot blood from your eyes as a swift action. The blood deals damage equal to 1d6+1 hp per 2 caster levels. Each time you fire a stream of blood, you take 1 hp damage. You cannot use this spell if it would drop your hp to 0; if you try to do so, the spell simply ends.

If you have divine blood (you are a demigod, an outsider with 20 or more HD, or have godling class levels from Super Genius Games' The Genius Guide to the Godling), targets damaged by this spell are also dazzled for the spell's duration
