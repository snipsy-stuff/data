### 📜 Description
The victim's skeleton writhes and twists within his body, tearing muscles and rupturing flesh. The victim suffers 2d8 points of damage, +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). If the damage dealt by this spell brings the target to -10 hit points or below, his skeleton tears from its body and becomes an animated skeleton. (See 'skeleton" in the Pathfinder Bestiary.) This skeleton is under the caster's control in all respects as if it had been created by the animate dead spell. Should the skeleton possess too many Hit Dice for the caster to control, it remains independent and immediately attacks the nearest creature.
