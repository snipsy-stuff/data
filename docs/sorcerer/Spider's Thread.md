### 📜 Description
You create a single ropelike strand of spider web that possesses the Strength of an above-average person. One end of the strand is adhesive, the rest is not. You can use the sticky end to shoot the strand to the ceiling of a cave and swing across a chasm on it. You could even attempt to stick one end to a creature so it could not get away. In this case, the creature gets a saving throw, and those who fail must take a standard action to attempt a Strength check (DC 15) to tear the strand away. The spider's thread can support the weight of about 200 lbs. If you use it as rope (tying it to something rather than relying on the adhesive) it proves about twice as strong as a normal rope. The spider's thread can be destroyed in 1 round by fire. The strand has a hardness of 2 and 5 hit points.
