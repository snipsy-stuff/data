### 📜 Description
You delay a spell by up to 1 minute/caster level. This delay affects an area or instantaneous spell that you cast immediately after casting clockwork timer.

When the time expires, the delayed spell is immediately activated. The spell generates a distinctive ticking sound that can be heard with a DC 15 Perception check within 50 ft. of the spell effect.

A successful dispel magic removes both clockwork timer and the spell it is delaying. A caster who spends 10 minutes crafting a clockwork timer and then succeeds on a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell level) makes the timer more resistant to dispel magic and similar effects, increasing the dispel DC by +4.
