### 📜 Description
You steal control of a construct or undead creature under the control of another creature. If this control is based on a spell or spell-like ability, you control that spell as if you had cast the spell. If the existing controller is within line of site of the undead or construct creature at this time, you make opposed Charisma checks with the winner gaining ultimate control over the creature. A standard action is required to give mental or verbal orders to a commanded creature. You cannot command a creature or a total number of creatures whose total Hit Dice exceeds twice your caster level. Any creature that has been subjected to a change command spell cannot be affected by any other change command spells for 24 hours. This spell does not affect the mind of the target creature nor the caster, for it targets the spell or effect that is in control.
