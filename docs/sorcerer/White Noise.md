### 📜 Description
This spell causes the target object to emit loud, unspecific sound bursts and white light that makes hearing and seeing difficult. All Perception checks within 60 feet of the target object suffer a -5 penalty. A foot of stone or three inches of iron blocks the  sound created by this spell. White noise also negates blindsight and blindsense abilities based on hearing. Creatures relying entirely on hearing for perception are effectively blinded. You do not see or hear anything out of the ordinary beyond 60 feet.
