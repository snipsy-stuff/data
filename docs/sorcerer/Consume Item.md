### 📜 Description
Your successful melee touch attack ruins one magic item. You gain temporary hit points equal to 3 points per caster level of the magic item (though you cannot gain more than twice you normal hp total in temporary hit points). The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. A successful saving throw results in the item suffering half its hit points in damage and gaining the broken condition (but it cannot be subject to this spell again for 24 hours) and you gain only half the amount of temporary hit points. Artifacts are immune to this spell; it does, however, affect constructs but does not bypass the magic immunity of a golem.
