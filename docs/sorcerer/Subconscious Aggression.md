### 📜 Description
Your words cause your target's clumsy attack to become a venting of pent up wrath against an ally. You force a target that has just rolled a natural 1 on an attack roll to instead make a normal attack roll with that same attack against its nearest ally within range of the attack (if there are multiple allies roll randomly). If the creature makes a successful save, has no ally, or if all its allies are out of attack range, the results of the natural 1 roll occur normally.
