### 📜 Description
This spell allows the caster to make metal plates adhere and meld with his skin, literally bonding armor to him. The metal plates are the material focus of the spell, and grant both a +5 armor bonus and damage reduction 5/adamantine. Due to the nature of the metal actually merging with the caster's skin, no armor check penalties or the like are inflicted by the temporary armor. After the duration of the spell has expired, the armor plates simply drop off.

This is a common spell amongst the priesthood of mechanist sects.
