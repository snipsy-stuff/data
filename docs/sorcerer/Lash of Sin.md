### üìú Description
From your lips, brightly glowing runes fall and coalesce in your hand, gathering in such a way as to form a thick and long whip made of multicolored force. When you cast this spell, a shimmering multihued whip of force comes into being in your hand. This can be used as a normal whip, but it has several unique properties. You are treated as proficient when wielding this whip, and you do not suffer any penalty for attacking a foe in melee with another creature. The whip deals 3d6 points of damage upon a successful touch attack and since it is made of force, it can hit ethereal and incorporeal targets, bypassing all damage reduction (but not hardness). There is no save against this aspect of the spell. 

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the infernal whip strikes it. If the whip is successfully resisted, it has no further effect on that creature. 

If not, the whip can strike that creature, which cannot apply SR to the whip's additional abilities (although it gets saves against these abilities as normal). If you release the whip, it vanishes, but you can recall it to your hand as a free action so long as the duration of the spell has not expired and it has not been dispelled. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The whip cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. In addition, each time you damage a foe with the whip, it produces one of several spell-like effects listed in the table that follows. All effects target only the creature damaged by the whip. The save DC is equal to the spell's DC.
