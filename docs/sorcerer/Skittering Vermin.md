### 📜 Description
The target of this spell is beset on all sides by images of shadowy, skittering, demonic varmints that dart from the shadows just beyond the target's field of vision. The target can ignore the mocking phantasms with a Will save-if the save succeeds, it is merely staggered for 1 round as it catches a satisfactory glimpse of the flitting images to recognize them for what they are. On a failed saved, the malevolent images distract and consume the target's attention. The threat of the shadowy vermin's impending attack reduces the target to half speed, the target cannot take attacks of opportunity, and it is always considered flanked.
