### üìú Description
You modify up to five minutes of all creatures' recollections of a single fact in one of the following ways:

1. Eliminate all memory of an event that people still living actually experienced. All creatures (except for you and those within range you designate) forget the event. This use of the spell can even undo the effects of a mind-affecting spell cast during that time even though where the event took place must be within range.

2. Erase the details of a fact that no one living (except perhaps you) remembers or knows, from all written records. This use of the spell eradicates the fact forever and divination magic will function as if this fact never existed. If someone living does know the fact, the spell fails, although it does reveal the name(s) of the one(s) who knows. A single fact includes the password to open an ancient tomb, the name or truename of a creature, or the location of a lost city.

3. Change the details of an event that no one living remembers or knows about, but which lies in written records. If someone living does know the details of the event, the spell fails, although it does reveal the name(s) of the one(s) who knows.

4. Implant a false memory of an event or a fact into the written records. If this use of the spell results in multiple "answers" to a question that a sage seeks in the written records, the sage has an equal chance of discovering any one of them. The caster gets no warning that there are multiple answers. 

Deities are immune to the effects of this spell, and are not considered living creatures for the purposes of the spell, GMs are encouraged that deities remain silent on the effects of this spell lest they start a war with the deity governing magic and/or secrets they wish hidden be revealed. A single five-minute duration or a single fact that occurred during those five minutes can only be affected by this spell once. You cannot, for example, erase the fact from memory and then erase the whole five minutes from all recorded records.
