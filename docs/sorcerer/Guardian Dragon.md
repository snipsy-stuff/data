### 📜 Description
You conjure a phantom dragon that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The dragon immediately roars if any Small or larger creature approaches within 60 feet of it. (Those within 60 feet of the dragon when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the roar.) The dragon has blindsense, true seeing, and can see ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.

If an intruder approaches to within 30 feet of the dragon, the dragon stops roaring and delivers a breath weapon every 1d4 rounds (60-ft. cone, same DC as this spell, 1d6 fire per caster level). If it cannot breathe without harming those in the area at the time of casting, or cannot breathe this round, it delivers a vicious bite instead (attack bonus equal to your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier, causing 4d6 + your relevant caster ability modifier of piercing damage) once per round. The dragon also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature (see invisibility). 

The dragon is considered ready to bite or breathe on its intruders, so it delivers its first bite or breath weapon on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic piercing weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The dragon cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for 1 day per caster level, but once the dragon begins roaring, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 200 feet distant from the dragon, the spell ends.
