### 📜 Description
The energy of this spell creates a near transparent arcane sigil on the face, hand, or other prominent feature of the creature touched. Those bearing this sigil are protected from damage by force effects, such as magic missile, in a manner similar to protection from energy. When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of force damage, sigil of force ends. The spell also provides the creature touched with a special ability. The creature can move through a wall of force once, ignoring it as if it were not there. If the creature uses this ability, the spell ends immediately afterward. Sigil of force does not grant the creature the ability to make attacks through a wall of force, only to move through it. Recipients also possess the ability to cast a ray of force from the palm of the hand that inflicts the total damage the sigil has absorbed, if a ranged touch attack strikes the target within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level). Using this ray of force ability is a standard action that immediately dismisses the sigil of force.
