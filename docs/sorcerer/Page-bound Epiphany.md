### 📜 Description
You magically scour the world’s libraries for information that might refresh your memory about a topic. Upon casting this spell, the focus book’s pages fill with snippets and selections from countless books. You can spend up to 1 round per caster level (maximum 10) reading these notes. You may cease reading at any time, and when you do you can immediately attempt one Knowledge check with a +1 circumstance bonus for each round you spent studying the book (maximum +10). The writing disappears when the spell ends, and if you fail to succeed at a Knowledge check on the round you stop reading the notes, you don’t gain the benefits of this spell.
