### 📜 Description
You set a creature on fire and fling it with telekinesis, potentially hitting nearby opponents or objects. The target takes 8d6 points of fire damage and is set on fire (1d6 additional each round) A creature can extinguish the target as a full-round action. You also hurl the target at any creature or object within range of the spell. You must make an attack roll whenever you use the target as a weapon. The attack bonus for this attack is equal to your caster level plus either your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit the new target with the creature, both it and the creature take damage based on the creature's size plus 2d6 fire.

The target struck by the subject of this spell must make a Reflex saving throw or also be set on fire. If the subject would be killed or destroyed by the damage this spell inflicts, it remains intact until after is has been hurled. A successful saving throw halves the initial damage (4d6), the subject is not set on fire and is not hurled at another target.
