### 📜 Description
This spell makes coins and jewels of a certain value of appear 10x more valuable than their true worth. Art objects seem to show higher craftsmanship and seem to be made of better materials. Copper appears to be gold, and common gemstones resemble rare ones. Appraise checks without touching the material automatically causes the appraiser to assume a higher value. If the appraiser touches or moves the treasure, the appraiser gets a Will save to determine that the treasure is in fact less valuable.
