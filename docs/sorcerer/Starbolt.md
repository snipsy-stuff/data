### 📜 Description
You unleash a shower of bright force bolts that falls from the heavens in a 20-ft. cube and illuminates targets. This spell creates one bolt at 1st level and one additional bolt for each two additional levels; thus, you command two bolts at 3rd level, three at 5th, and so on. The bolts deals 1d6+1 damage and can be targeted separately at any creatures in the area. In addition, a creature hit by a starbolt must make a Fortitude save or be dazed for the remainder of the round.
