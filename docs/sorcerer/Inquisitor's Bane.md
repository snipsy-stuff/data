### 📜 Description
You obscure and hedge the truth magically, cancelling the effect of zone of truth and providing a +5 insight bonus to the DC of opposed Sense Motive checks. In this way, a devilish cultist or a rogue with a spellcasting friend can confound inquisitors, devil smiters, and witch hunters. This spell has no effect on other divinations, such as augury, detect thoughts, or clairaudience. A detect magic plainly shows the use of an illusion on the subject of the spell.
