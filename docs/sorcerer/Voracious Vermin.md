### 📜 Description
Like skittering vermin the targets of this spell are besieged by phantasms of small, strange, imp-like creatures darting among the shadows. Unlike that spell, however, the mocking malevolence of the shadowy varmints is a tangible threat capable of actually harming the spell's targets.

The affected targets are aware that as long as they move at half speed, avoid taking attacks of opportunity, and are considered flanked due to the distraction of the voracious vermin, attacks from the skittering horrors produced by the spell's effect are warded. The vocacious vermin attack any target that moves at full speed, that is the target of an attack of opportunity, or that chooses to forego the flanking penalty on any given round.

The conjured vermin have an attack bonus equal to your level, deal 1d6 hp slashing damage + your Intelligence modifier per attack, and gain bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature (see invisibility). Each affected target that forgoes the precaution penalties may be attacked once per round. Though affected subjects may see brief glimpses of the attacking entities, they are treated as a spell effect, not actual creatures, and cannot be attacked. They can be dispelled normally.
