### 📜 Description
You enhance the hooves of a target creature, imbuing it with power and swiftness. The target increases its base speed by 30 ft. (up to a maximum of twice its base speed). In addition, this spell grants two hoof attacks that deal 1d6 hp damage plus 1/2 the target's Strength modifier (1d8 if the target of the spell is Large). These attacks are treated as secondary natural attacks, even if they are the target's only natural attacks. Finally, the hoofed creature may deal hoof damage to the target of any successful bull rush or overrun combat maneuver.
