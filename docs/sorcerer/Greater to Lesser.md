### 📜 Description
A dragon targeted by this spell becomes a lesser dragon determined by the caster of no more than 1/3 its current HD. The creature retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as all of its extraordinary and supernatural abilities, which are subject to the new form's HD and physical stats.

Breath weapons are limited to half its new HD (minimum of 1 die of damage). Additionally, it loses any spell-like abilities available to adult or older dragons, and its spell casting is limited to 0- and 1st-level spells.

A creature under the effect of a form of the dragon spell that fails the save changes to a drake of the related drake form spell (for example, a creature benefitting from form of the dragon II becomes a drake as per drake form II). If you use the eggshell the spell's target hatched from as a material component, the creature suffers -8 to its saving throw.
