### üìú Description
You create a phantasmal image of a tripwire by forming the thoughts of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: a wire strung in front of its feet. Only the spell's subject can sense the phantasmal tripwire. You see only a vague shape near its feet. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the sensation as unreal. If that save fails, the subject believes the tripwire is real. The subject then must succeed on a second Will save or fall prone and suffer 1d3 nonlethal damage. If the subject of phantasmal tripwire succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the image of the tripwire can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to believing that you're caught up in a trip wire upon which you must succeed on a second Will save or fall prone and suffer 1d3 nonlethal damage.
