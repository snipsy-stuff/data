### 📜 Description
Manipulating the powers necessary to invoke any spell is a complex balancing act, and the target of this spell suffers a minor backlash when unleashing that power. Whenever the target successfully casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, it is teleported 10 ft. in a random direction. In addition, it is staggered until the end of its next turn.

Roll a d10 and use the rules for splash weapons to determine the direction the target is teleported. On a roll of a 9, the target is teleported straight up, while a result of 10 teleports it straight down.

If the target's destination location is occupied, such as by another creature or a wall, the target does not teleport but is knocked prone instead.
