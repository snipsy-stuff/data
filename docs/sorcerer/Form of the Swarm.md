### 📜 Description
This spell allows you to take the form of four separate swarms; these can be army ant, bat, centipede, crab, leech, rat, spider, and/or wasp swarms. You can choose from one to four of any of the types; you could, for example, choose two centipede and two spider swarms. These swarms have all their normal qualities and abilities but also bear a tiny portion of your consciousness that allows you to perceive what they do and to control their actions. While in this form, you cannot use any of your own abilities or take any actions other than controlling the swarms. If all of the swarms are destroyed you are transformed back into your normal self in the same condition you were when you cast the spell. If you dismiss the spell or it is dispelled, choose one of the squares previously occupied by any one of the remaining swarms and that is where you reappear. Casters often use this spell as a form of escape, sending three of the swarms to attack their foes while using the fourth flying swarm (bats or wasps) to flee.
