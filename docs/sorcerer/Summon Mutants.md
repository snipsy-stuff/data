### 📜 Description
You summon 1d4+1 mongrelmen; 1d3 morlocks, ogrekin, or mana-wasted or giant mongrelmen a single mana-wasted or giant morlock or ogrekin or a mongrelman with both the giant and mana-wasted templates. The summoned mutants understand your speech and obey your commands. This spell otherwise functions as summon monster I.

Creatures with the giant simple template increase their size by one category and the damage dice for their attacks by one step. Their natural armor bonus to Armor Class increases by 3 and they gain a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a -2 penalty to Dexterity. The mana-wasted template is described in Chapter 4: Monsters.
