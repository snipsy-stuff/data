### üìú Description
You sketch a 5-ft.-by-5-ft. string of translucent arcane symbols on any surface. Doing so brings a Tiny construct to life to act as a guard, scout, or trap.

The cipher can straighten out and move like a snake, squeezing through openings that only tiny sized creatures may fit.

A harrying cipher can deliver a jolt of force during melee that causes nonlethal damage. It may trip a Medium or smaller sized creature by wrapping itself around their legs; when it succeeds with a jolt attack, it can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot attempt to trip the harrying cipher. Creatures receive a Reflex save against all jolt attacks.

You cannot see or hear what the cipher sees, but the cipher can report back to you and answer very simple questions (regarding number, distance, etc.) by rearranging its wording and allowing you to read the answer, if you  instructed the cipher to seek out this information. A harrying cipher can perform only one simple task or answer one simple question at time. (If scouting for enemies, for example, a cipher could report back how many beings it saw, but it could not report their distance from the doorway unless sent to scout a second time.)

A harrying cipher moves to the limit of the spell's range and then waits for you, its master. Ciphers forced beyond this range wink out of existence.

Use of illusory script in conjunction produces an invisible cipher construct.

This spell's material component is ink to sketch the cipher mixed with your own fresh blood, which deals 3 hp damage to you. This damage cannot be healed as long as the cipher exists.

Addition from Harrying Cipher: Cipher gains force attack, more capabilities.
