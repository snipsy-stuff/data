### 📜 Description
A doom of the slippery rogue spell covers a wall or floor with a thin coating of bacon fat or similar oil. Climbers immediately fall from the surface if they fail a DC 50 Climb check. Standing creatures must make a successful Reflex save or fall prone. A creature can walk within or through the area at half normal speed with a DC 20 Acrobatics check. Failure means it must make another Reflex save or fall, while failure by 5 or more means it falls. Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.

The caster can move the area affected each round as a swift action on his or her turn. Each 5-ft. square must remain in contact with at least one other square of the spell (or else that square simply stops being slippery), and each square can move up to 10 ft. Creatures that begin their turn in a slippery section must make a saving throw as described.
