### 📜 Description
You instantly prepare any one spell of 6th level or lower that you have successfully identified (Spellcraft check DC 15+ spell level) during the past 24 hours and is part of your class spell list. The chosen spell is stored in your mind as through prepared in the normal fashion (if you cannot prepare spells the spell fails). If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. The replicated spell is not usable until the material components are available.
