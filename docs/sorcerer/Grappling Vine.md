### üìú Description
When you cast this spell, a thick, sticky vine launches from your outstretched hand. You make a ranged touch attack against an opponent up to 30 feet away. If the touch attack hits, you can make an opposed grapple check against the opponent on the same round. Treat the vine as having a CMB equal to your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier. The vine maintains the grapple by itself (so you don't have to move into the opponent's space), and will continue to grapple while you make other attacks. 

You can't move more than 30 feet from the target creature without releasing it or dispelling the vine, though the vine contracts and expands as needed so that you can move freely within the 30-foot range. The round following a successful grapple, the vine automatically attempts to pin the opponent, dealing 1d6 plus your relevant caster ability modifier points of damage per round to a pinned foe. Once an opponent is struck and grappled, the vine does not let loose until the opponent is dead, the spell ends, or you release the grappled creature voluntarily.

If you miss with the ranged touch attack, the vine writhes uncontrollably for the rest of the round. On the following round, you can make another ranged touch attack against any creature within range. You can continue to do this until the spell expires or is dispelled. 

You can cast spells while the vine is grappling, but you must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to do so. Spells with somatic or material components require your other hand to remain free. 

The vine has hardness 5 and 10 hit points per two caster levels. Dealing at least 15 points of slashing damage severs it, freeing any currently grappled opponent. The severed tip instantly shrivels into dust, but the vine regrows quickly and is ready to latch onto a new target on your next turn.
