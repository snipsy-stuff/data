### 📜 Description
This spell causes a creature to suffer from insane levels of endless wracking pains that impose a -8 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. In addition, the creature is staggered by the shear agony. Upon a successful save, the subject negates the staggered condition but suffers from a -4 circumstance penalty on attack roll, skill checks and ability for 1 round. 

Remove curse does not remove unending torment. Mass heal, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.
