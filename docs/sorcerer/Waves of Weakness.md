### 📜 Description
You unleash a cone of putrid green energy from your outstretched hands. All creatures in the area take 5d4 points of Strength damage and are dazed for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage, negates the dazed condition and renders the subject immune to subsequent castings of this spell from the same caster for 24 hours. A character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious.
