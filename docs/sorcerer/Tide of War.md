### 📜 Description
You cause a translucent wave of crimson energy to roll out from the target area, making it appear to be awash with blood. Creatures in the area that fail their saves are caught up in the throes of the magic, believing themselves to be in the last desperate battle of a war against their most hated foes. On their next action, all affected creatures attack the nearest creature with their most damaging attack. This attack can be of any sort, so long as it is the most effective means of killing the nearest creature. Creatures in the area of effect must make a successful saving throw each round to avoid attacking the nearest creature. On the rounds following the casting, you can direct the tide of war to move in a straight line, sweeping up new creatures in its effect. You may take this free action once per round by making a simple gesture. The tide of war may be moved up to 30 feet per round in this fashion. Creatures in the areas the spell moves over, or that do not leave the area, must make saves to resist its effects.
