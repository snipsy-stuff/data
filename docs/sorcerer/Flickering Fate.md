### 📜 Description
The target sees the flickering shadows of a few seconds into the future. When the spell is cast, all creatures within range must declare their actions for the round before the subject of the spell declares his. All creatures receive a Will saving throw; those who succeed need not follow the course of action they declared. Those who fail must take their action exactly as declared. The subject of this spell gains a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, AC, and saving throws against any creature that failed its saving throw.
