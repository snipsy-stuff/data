### 📜 Description
A cloud of searing hot particles deals 4d6 points of fire damage to everything in its area of effect, and blinds creatures for duration of the spell. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness but doesn't reduce the damage. The dust cannot be removed, and anything it coats takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each round the spell lasts. Undead, fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes take 4d8 points of damage initially and 1d8 points of damage each round. While the spell lasts, anything coated with the dust sheds light as a torch. In addition, creatures coated with the dust take a -40 penalty on Stealth checks, and invisible creatures or objects in the area are outlined and made visible for the duration of the spell. A magical darkness effect of 6th level or higher suppresses the light from this spell, but does not keep the dust from burning.
