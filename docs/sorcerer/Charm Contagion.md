### 📜 Description
As charm monster, except when the subject greets someone whom he has not seen since the spell took effect, he takes the opportunity to tell that person good things about you. Anyone hearing about you from someone affected by charm contagion must make a saving throw as if the spell were being cast on him in the manner you originally cast it. On a save, a victim of charm contagion can discuss other subjects normally. The spell duration for each affected person starts at the moment of being charmed. Anyone who makes the saving throw is immune to all charm contagion effects that originated from the same initial casting. If you dismiss the spell, you only dismiss it on subjects of whom you are aware.
