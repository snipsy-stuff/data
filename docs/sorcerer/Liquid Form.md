### üìú Description
The subject and all its gear become liquid and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, although its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply.

The subject gains DR 10/magic, takes half damage from falling and from piercing and slashing weapons, and becomes immune to sonic damage, sneak attacks, and critical hits. It cannot attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in liquid form. It can use certain spells that it may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in liquid form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the liquid form spell takes effect.

A liquid creature cannot run, but it can move across horizontal surfaces at a speed of 10 ft., or 20 ft. on a down slope. It can enter water and has a swim speed of 10 ft. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even cracks, with all was wearing or holding in its hands as long as the spell persists. It cannot manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its liquid form.

Continuously active items remain active. While underwater in this form, the subject is invisible. Unlike normal invisibility that displaces water and leaves a visible, body-shaped bubble, the subject blends in perfectly, and gains total concealment (50% miss chance).
