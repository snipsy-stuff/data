### 📜 Description
You infuse one of your attended manufactured weapons with any 5th level or lower spell on your spell list that requires a melee touch attack to deliver. Then, for the remaining duration, each time you strike an opponent with that chosen weapon, but no more than once per round, you cast the spell upon that opponent as well as inflicting whatever damage you normally would deal. The effect only works when you are the only person attending and wielding the weapon. Making a single melee attack is part of the casting of this spell.
