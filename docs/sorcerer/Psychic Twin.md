### 📜 Description
You forge a psychic link between you and one target humanoid within range. Once the link is established, you share the experiences of your ally, granting both of you the ability to use each other's ranks in any skill (though not your ability score modifiers) in place of your own. In addition, while under the effects of psychic twin, neither character can be flanked unless both characters are flanked. Likewise, neither character is surprised unless both characters are surprised.
