### 📜 Description
This spell enables you to reduce the speed of a creature by a factor that varies according to your level. You reduce the target's speed by as much as 5 ft. up to level 5; by as much as 10 ft. up to level 10; by as much as 15 ft. up to level 15; and by as much as 20 ft. for level 16 or higher. You can't immobilize a creature completely with this spell; a target can always move at least 5 ft. and can still run, albeit not as fast as usual.

A northern variant of this spelled called myling's burden is said to encumber its target with the souls of childen that died young. This variant is also usable by white necromancers as a 1st-level spell, and is of the school of necromancy rather than clockwork, but is identical to not so fast in all other respects.
