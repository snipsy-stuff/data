### 📜 Description
You spit out a foul word that causes a target to gawk in amazement for a few moments. If the target fails its Will save against this spell, it must delay its action until the end of the current round (its initiative for this round is effectively reduced to 0), and it is dazed until that turn begins. If the target succeeds on its save, it can act normally on its next turn, with its normal initiative, but it is dazed until that time.

If you have a number of insanity points greater than the target’s Hit Dice, it takes a −2 penalty to its save against this effect.
