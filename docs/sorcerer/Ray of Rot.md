### 📜 Description
You fire a brown ray from your outstretched fingertip that fills the air with the stench of rotting plant matter. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target with the ray. It deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) to any plant or vegetable creature or object it strikes (including all creatures of the plant type, but also wooden buildings or constructs). This attack ignores DR and hardness. If the object or creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses into a pulpy mass of black goo.
