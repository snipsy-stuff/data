### 📜 Description
A variant of the famous spell grease, this spell imbues the slippery grease it creates with essence from the Dark Tapestry, making the victims hear sounds and words from the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones.

This spell functions like grease, except the creatures that fall in the area or use the greased item take Wisdom damage equal to 1d6+1 hp per two levels (maximum +5). This damage doesn't stack, but the target must make a save each round spent in the grease or using the item.
