### 📜 Description
Your eyes peel away from front to back, leaving empty sockets as your eyes move to another dimension and reorient their gaze. Like looking down at a floor plan, you look down at the world from your hyperdimensional vantage point.

You see the world exactly as you normally would, except dim light replaces all natural lighting conditions. Solids appear translucent. Magical barriers appear opaque. Vision-hampering magic, such as darkness, still applies.

By concentrating, you can move your eyes 30 ft. per round in any direction. Solid barriers do not block your eyes, but magical barriers do. Thus, you can see an arrowhead lodged in a body or a treasure inside a locked chest behind a secret door, but you cannot see or move your eyes through a wall of force. You cannot see if you are blinded, and a creature can only notice your roving eyes if that creature exists in or sees into additional dimensions (e.g. with this or similar spells).
