### 📜 Description
With a grand gesture, you send a rippling wave of crushing pressure toward your enemies. This deals 1d6 hp bludgeoning damage/level to anyone in the area (max 20d6). If cast above ground, any creature that fails the Fortitude save must also make a Reflex save to avoid being knocked prone. If cast underwater, any creature that fails its Fortitude save must also make an additional Fortitude save or become fatigued.
