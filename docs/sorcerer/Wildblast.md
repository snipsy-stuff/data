### 📜 Description
Wildblast is an unpredictable spell. When cast, you simply choose a point of origin within range. Then the spell explodes in a spread with a radius of 4d10 feet, rolled randomly each time (round to the nearest five feet for tactical purposes). The type of energy dealt by the spell is one or two of the five energies as determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting the table below.

Table: Wildblast Energy Type D6  Energy Type 1     Acid 2     Cold 3     Electricity 4     Fire 5     Sonic 6     Roll again twice. (Damage is split between elements, not doubled; ignore further rolls of a six.)

Determining the number of damage dice is done by rolling 1d20 and adding your caster level (maximum +15) to the roll, then consulting the following table.
