### 📜 Description
This spell allows a caster to manipulate one of the four elements and form it into a ray or sphere to hurl at a target. The element used as the material component dictates the resulting form of the spell.

Using any source of one of the elements (air, earth, fire, water), the caster manipulates and magnifies it into a more dense form suitable for hurling toward a single target. It requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 2d6 + 1 hp damage per level (maximum +10, type listed below). Each element also has a secondary effect.

Air: Bludgeoning damage. If target is hit, it is subject to a bull rush attack from the force of the air. The CMB uses level in place of its base attack bonus.

Earth: Bludgeoning damage. The debris trail from this attack blinds the target for 1 round. Fortitude save negates.

Fire: Fire damage. The intense flames burn the target on the following round for 2d4 fire damage. Reflex save negates.

Water: Bludgeoning damage. The impact of the water dazes the target for one additional round. Fortitude save negates.
