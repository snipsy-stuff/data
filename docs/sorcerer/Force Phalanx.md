### 📜 Description
This spell calls forth dozens of indistinct humanoid forms bearing large shields and readied spears. This phalanx cannot move and provides considerable protection to creatures behind it. The force phalanx is treated as a single object, has hardness 30 and a number of hp equal to 10x your level. If the phalanx takes damage equal to its hp, it disappears. Creatures behind the phalanx may attack through the phalanx, provided they have reach weapons or can otherwise hit opponents 10 ft. away.

The spears created by the spell do not attack creatures normally, but any creature charging the phalanx takes 2d6 hp damage if one of the spears strikes it. The spear has an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus plus the modifier associated with your primary spellcasting attribute.
