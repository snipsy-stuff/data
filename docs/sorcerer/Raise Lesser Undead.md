### 📜 Description
This spell functions as animate dead except that it can create a single skeleton or zombie with a maximum number of HD equal to your 1/2 your level, to a maximum 5 HD at 10th level. You cannot have more than one undead creature under your control through this spell. If you cast this spell a second time, the first creature immediately crumbles to dust. This creature counts against your maximum limit of undead creatures you can control.
