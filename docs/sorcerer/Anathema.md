### 📜 Description
The spell charges the area around you with arcane energy of a sort that the gods themselves find most unpleasant. This form of energy also interferes with the prayers of the faithful, making it more difficult for divine words of power to be invoked. Divine spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50% for any divine spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on divine spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on divine spells that were already cast before the caster entered the anathema area of effect.
