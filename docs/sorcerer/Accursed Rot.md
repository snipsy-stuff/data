### üìú Description
This spell infects both a powerful curse and a horrible rotting disease.

Accursed Rot

Type curse and disease, contact Save Fortitude DC as the spell Onset instantaneous Frequency 1/round Effect 1d6 Con Cure remove curse followed by cure disease (or similar spell), miracle or wish spell.

Accursed rot attempts to dispel (as described in greater dispel magic) any and all spells or spell-like abilities on the target that directly or indirectly interfere with this accursed rot taking effect. For example, a character casts accursed rot and touches a subject with iron body. A dispel check is made (DC 11 + the caster level of the spell immunity). If the dispel succeeds, the iron body is dispelled before the accursed rot takes effect. Accursed rot's dispelling can only affect spells cast upon a living creature. Independent spell effects or those affecting an area cannot be dispelled, even if they prevent the accursed rot from affecting the attending creature.

Accursed rot can dispel spells and magic items specifically intended to foil the spell in question (spell immunity), that provide general protection from spells (spell resistance), and/or offer any bonuses to the saving throws (cloak of resistance). You make a check for each instance of protection; a magic item so affected is suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds.

Normally to remove the curse and cure the disease on another creature, a caster must touch the victim; this constitutes contact for purposes of spreading the disease so the caster of a remove curse or a remove disease would instantly become infected. In addition, even after the curse element of accursed rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature must succeed on a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level), or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect; this effect ends once a creature is fully healed of the Constitution damage dealt by accursed rot.

Anyone who dies from accursed rot turns to dust and cannot be raised without a true resurrection and even after they are raised they are still afflicted by accursed rot until it is cured.
