### üìú Description
You weave wild energies into the souls of the targeted creatures, connecting them through the common thread of chaos. The wild energy distorts each affected creature's life-force, making it waver and shift randomly with the other life forces. Any spell effect targeted at the mind or soul of one of the affected creatures instead affects a random target among those connected by the soul current. If any creature moves beyond the range of the spell, it is removed from the spell effect. If a given creature succeeds at its Will save, it does not become part of the current, but the spell still functions for those who either wish to be joined or who fail their save. For the duration of soul current, whenever a creature connected to the soul current is affected by a spell that requires a Will save, or that has the [death] or [mind-affecting] descriptors, determine randomly which creature is affected. If a single spell affects several creatures, roll once for each creature that would have been affected.

For example, a 17th level necromancer links himself and five of his henchmen with soul current; as long as they remain within 1080 feet of the necromancer, they remain connected. If a cleric cast destruction on the necromancer, one random person of the six in the soul current will be affected, as long as they are within 1080 feet of the necromancer, even if they are beyond the normal range of destruction. If later the necromancer and all his companions are targeted by a mass charm, you would roll six times to determine which were affected. It would be possible, though unlikely, for the same person to be affected six times, leaving the others unharmed.
