### 📜 Description
This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a symbol of stunning instead become stunned for 1d6 rounds.

Note: Magic traps such as symbol of stunning are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of stunning and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for symbol of stunning.
