### 📜 Description
This spell creates a shadow demi-space, dimly lit and designed to the caster's whim, with floating platforms, ledges, pits, ramps or short walls - up to one such object per level, occupying no more than a cube, five feet on a side. Such objects may be combined, to create larger pits, ramps, etc., but each portion counts as an object toward the total. Those within the area of effect who fail their save are trapped inside the arena until there is a victor or, if no foes exist, until the duration expires. Those who succeed are safely shunted outside the space or, if no safe space exists, are rendered invisible until the spell expires or they engage a combatant - at which time they have entered the arena as some who has failed their save. From outside, the arena appears to be a charcoal-colored, opaque hemisphere. Spell effects may not enter the arena, and no one within may leave until the battle is complete or there is no one with whom to enter combat. Those who enter the arena freely receive no saving throw, and remain trapped as if they failed the initial saving throw.
