### üìú Description
This spell plants a subconscious directive in the target‚Äôs mind that forces him to act as you dictate when specific circumstances arise. The target humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must understand your language. Upon casting this spell you must state a course of action you wish the target to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you wish the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. Unconscious agenda cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast.

If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way, has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he wishes until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell dominate person. For the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all it can to fulfill your command. If, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of action is completed the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts performed during this hour. For example, a wizard might cast unconscious agenda upon a farmer, giving him the order ‚Äúmurder the king‚Äù to be acted upon ‚Äúwhen you hear church bells strike noon.‚Äù Thus, the next time the target hears church bells strike noon, the enchantment activates and for the next hour he does all he can to murder the king in the most effective way possible, with the spell ending either when the king is dead or the hour passes. How the target acts is wholly relative to the individual and the circumstances. This could lead the target to perform an assassination attempt or, if he‚Äôs some distance away from where he thinks the king is, ride for one hour at full speed towards the land‚Äôs capital.

It‚Äôs difficult to detect an unconscious agenda. Casting detect magic on someone affected by this spell only reveals an aura of enchantment magic if the caster of detect magic has a higher caster level then the caster of unconscious agenda. Even if the spell is detected, it can only be removed by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect unconscious agenda.
