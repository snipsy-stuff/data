### üìú Description
You concentrate on pulling additional magical energy through a functioning ley line as a full-round action. The following round, make a DC 15 caster level check for a weak ley line or a DC 20 caster level check for a strong one. If you succeed, the weak line generates a new effect determined randomly from the Strong Ley Line table  and a strong ley line subject to this spell generates a new effect randomly from the Titanic Ley Line table.

Once the ley line's power is increased, you must concentrate each round to maintain the new level of power. If the concentration ends or when the cantrip's duration expires, the ley line power immediately reverts to its prior level.
