### 📜 Description
You fire a thin orange beam at the target. You must make a ranged touch attack against the target. If you hit, and the target fails the save, the target becomes extremely susceptible to magic - spells find it easy to make their way to and affect the target. The target suffers a circumstance penalty to saving throws against spells, magic effects from items, and spell-like abilities, equal to -1 per two caster levels. Further, the spell reduces the spell resistance of targets by a like amount (-1 point per two caster levels). Targets who succeed at the Will save still suffer a  -1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against spells, magic effects from items, and spell-like abilities.
