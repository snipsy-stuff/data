### 📜 Description
The caster prepares a light, one-handed weapon (usually a dagger or sap), or an item that can be easily held in one hand, by wrapping and tying it with a string or strap. The end of the string is cut off.

The fragment detects faintly of conjuration magic. As an immediate action, the final word is spoken while holding the string. As long as the item is on the same plane of existence, it appears in the activator's hand, ready to use.
