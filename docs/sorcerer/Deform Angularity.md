### 📜 Description
Your body is transpatially distorted into otherworldly geometries too alien to contemplate. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to your Armor Class, and any effect targeting you has a 50% chance to bypass you and instead be redirected toward a random creature within 10 feet (or to simply fail, if no creature is within this range). Effects that you create are not affected, but even effects that do not require attack rolls or normally hit automatically can be affected. A creature using true strike ignores the effect of this spell.
