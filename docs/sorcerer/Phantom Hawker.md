### 📜 Description
This spell creates a disembodied voice that repeats a message continuously for the spell's duration. The message, which must be fifty or fewer words long, can be in any language you know, and can be delivered over a period of up to five minutes. The phantom hawker cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. You set the volume of the voice when you cast the spell - from a whisper to a shout.
