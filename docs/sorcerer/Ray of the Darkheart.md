### 📜 Description
With this spell you fire a blast of pure, unadulterated darkness at a single target. You must make a ranged touch attack at the target creature; if you are successful, the darkness envelops the target and seeps into him through his pores, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per level (maximum 20d6). Experiencing such concentrated darkness is traumatic to the target and inflicts the Cowering condition for one round per caster level. A successful save results in half damage and reduces the Cowering condition to the Shaken condition (and the creature gains immunity to the fear effects of this spell for 24 hours). 

Creatures that rely on light for food, such as most surface plants, or creatures that are otherwise dependent on light, take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). Subterranean creatures, constructs, and undead take only 1d4 points of damage per level (maximum 20d4). Creatures that are immune to fear effects cannot be shaken by this spell, but can still take damage. 

Creatures that are immune or resistant to cold effects cannot be damaged by this spell, but can still be cowered or shaken.
