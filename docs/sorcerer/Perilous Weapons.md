### 📜 Description
One creature's weapon, or two of its natural weapons, becomes magically sharp and prone to dealing devastating strikes. Upon a successful critical hit, its critical can cascade: the target creature continues to reroll confirmations of a critical hit at a -5 cumulative attack penalty even after the first confirmation until there's a miss, and each successful strike increases the weapon's critical multiplier by x1. Thus if a creature scores a critical with a perilous dagger (base critical x2), first he must roll a hit to confirm the critical, then roll again at a -5 attack penalty, then again at a -10 attack penalty, then again at a -15 penalty, etc., until he misses (for example, at a -20 penalty). The dagger in this case scored three additional successes beyond the initial critical, so the dagger's critical multiplier is increased to x5.
