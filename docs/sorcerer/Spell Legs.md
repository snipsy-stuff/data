### 📜 Description
You usurp control of a spell with an ongoing effect such as a fog cloud, stinking cloud or darkness and can move it at a rate of 20 ft. round as a move equivalent action. Spell effects that cannot be cast into certain areas or locations cannot be moved into those locations with spell legs. If the spell is under control of a spell caster already, such as a flaming sphere, you must make a Concentration check opposed by the Concentration check of the caster presently in control of the spell. If both checks succeed you wrest control of the spell away from the original caster and can turn the spell against the original caster. 

When the spell effect is moved over a target creature, that creature must make any saving throws the spell effect permits to avoid its effects. The saving throw, and spell effects, are those of the originally cast spell. If the creature has spell resistance a caster level check is made using the original caster's level. You can't usurp control of any spell effect above 3rd-level and the original caster can still dismiss any spell that can be dismissed.
