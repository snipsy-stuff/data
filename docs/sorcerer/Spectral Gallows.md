### 📜 Description
This spell calls forth invisible tentacles that encircle the necks of creatures in the affected area in an attempt to choke the life from them. Creatures that fail their Reflex save immediately suffer 1d8 hit points of damage per level of the caster (maximum 20d8) and are considered pinned. If attempting to escape or break a pin, assume that the tentacles have CMB equal to 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier. The tentacles continue their pins each round, causing 1d3 points of Constitution damage each round as they strangle the life from their targets. The tentacles will attempt to grapple any free opponents in the area each round with the same bonus as grapple attempts, though initial grapple attacks only deal 1d8 points of damage and pin the opponent. In following rounds, however, 1d3 points of Constitution damage will be dealt if the opponent has not broken free. 

Undead, constructs and other creatures that have no respiratory system or heads are still constricted by the tentacles and are considered pinned until they break free. These creatures suffer only 1d4 hit points of damage per level of the caster when they are initially pinned and an additional 1d4 hit points of constriction damage each round thereafter. When a creature escapes a tentacle's pin or the duration of the spell ends, releasing the creature, it is considered stunned for one round while it attempts to catch its breath or regain its balance.
