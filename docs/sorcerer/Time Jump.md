### 📜 Description
You throw a construct forward through time. Effectively, the target disappears for 1d4+1 rounds. During this time, the creature cannot be perceived or scryed upon in any way, nor can it act or be acted upon, even with a wish.

Persistent effects with durations that affect the creature each round do not affect it, and spells or effects on the creature with durations do not have their durations decreased. When the creature returns to the time stream, it is unaware that any time has passed.
