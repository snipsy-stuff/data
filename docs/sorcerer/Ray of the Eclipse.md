### 📜 Description
A pitch-black ray made from the strange, dark energies of space shoots from your finger and covers your enemy with a cold and cloying darkness. You fire one ray that deals 1d6 hp cold damage for every two levels (maximum 5d6 hp damage) and covers the target with sticky magical darkness. In addition, the target is blinded for 1 round or until the effect is ended.

The coating of darkness is considered an object for purposes of casting light and similar spells and effects. Casting light or similar spells at darkness dissipates the darkness and ends the blinded condition, but does not affect the damage taken.
