### 📜 Description
This curse turns everyone against the victims; trusted allies and companions believe the victims have betrayed them; people the victims have never met believe they are brigands, pirates and/or wanted criminals in disguise. All creatures who encounter the victims must make a Will saving throw (as the spell DC) or have their attitude toward the subjects become hostile (see the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). These creatures know that they have become subject to a spell effect and are likely to perceive this as an attack. Diplomacy checks made to reverse the effects of endless enemies are made at a -20 penalty. 

This spell cannot be dispelled, though it can be removed with a miracle or wish spell.
