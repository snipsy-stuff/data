### 📜 Description
By leveraging shortcuts through extradimensional space, you extend your natural reach by 5 ft. per 2 levels. When manipulating objects and landing melee and touch attacks at this augmented distance, your arm appears to end at an elbow of roiling flesh where it passes into the extradimensional space. A few feet later, your disconnected forearm and hand emerge at a similar knot of flesh. You gain a +2 attack bonus against any opponent who has not previously witnessed you perform an augmented reach with this spell.
