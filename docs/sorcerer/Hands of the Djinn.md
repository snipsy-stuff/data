### üìú Description
You call up elemental energy, which infuses your hands. Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 hp per 2 levels of that energy type (maximum 5d6), along with a special effect described below.

You deal this energy damage and the related special effect when you attack with an unarmed strike, a single claw, a bite, or a single slam attack. This bonus damage applies to multiple weapons.

Acid: Your touch attack causes 1 hp ongoing acid damage per die of damage for 3 rounds. The target must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for the duration of the ongoing acid damage

Cold: The target must make a Fortitude save or be exhausted. If a creature makes his save then the creature becomes fatigued. A fatigued creature becomes exhausted.

Electricity: When delivering elemental damage, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal). The target must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.

Fire: Your hands ignite and shed light as a torch. Your touch may set targets on fire (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), although a Reflex save prevents this. If the creature touched catches fire, it is shaken until the fire is extinguished.

When you cast this spell to deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, it is a spell of that type.
