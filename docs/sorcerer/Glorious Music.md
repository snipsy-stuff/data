### 📜 Description
You enchant your target, filling its head with a subconscious score of music that changes to fit the mood of the goings-on around it. The target makes no conscious note of the music, but its themes influence the target's emotions, making it more susceptible to manipulation. This effect provides a +1 circumstance bonus to all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks made against the target for the duration of the spell.
