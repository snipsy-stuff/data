### 📜 Description
Your eyes roll back in his head and you enter a deep trance, becoming fully rigid save for your writing hand, which must be dipped in ink. You commune with unknown forces and spirits, gleaning a useful piece of advice in reply to a question about a specific goal, event, or activity no more than one week in the future. You record this reply with an ink-stained finger.

The advice takes the form of a mysterious phrase, single word, picture, or rhyme recorded in ink. If the cryptic information is not acted upon, conditions may change that render the information useless.

The base chance for correct information is 60% +1% per level (maximum of 80%). If the dice roll fails, the caster does not know whether the information given was false. Multiple trances regarding the same topic produce the same result.

The blind man's eye or infected wheat used as a material component for this spell must be ingested as part of its casting.
