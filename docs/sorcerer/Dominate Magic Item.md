### 📜 Description
You can control the actions of any magic item (including constructs). Through this spell you establish a mental link with the item, forcing the item to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If you don't know what the magic item can do, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "come here," "go there," "fight," 'stay still," etc. You receive no direct sensory input from it. Attended and Intelligent subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Attended and Intelligent subjects do not carry out obviously selfdestructive orders. Once you establish control, there is no limit to the range at which you can exercise it, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. Magic circle against evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the link while the subject remains so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of dominate magic item or dispel it. Golems still gain the benefit of their magic immunity special defense against this spell.
