### 📜 Description
Lightning capacitor causes the touched object to store a vast charge of electrical energy. When a creature approaches within 15 feet of the target object, it releases the electricity as a bolt of lightning dealing 5d6 points of damage (Reflex save for half). For every three caster levels, the object will hold an additional bolt (to a maximum of 7 bolts). 

The bolts discharge at a rate of one per creature each round, so each creature in the area can only be struck by a bolt once each round, but multiple creatures within the area can be stuck the same round by different bolts. For example, lightning capacitor cast by a 13th level caster would originally contain four bolts. If two creatures approached the object in the same round they would both be stuck by separate bolts, draining two from the object, which would leave it with two bolts. If the creatures did not move away from the warded object, they would get struck again next round on their turn. If the object holding the charges is destroyed while it still has bolts remaining, the bolts are instantly released, all striking the nearest creature.

When cast, you may designate specific creatures that can come near the object without being stuck by its lightning bolts. The caster can also designate whether the object targeted appears as normal or if it crackles with a visible charge of electricity.
