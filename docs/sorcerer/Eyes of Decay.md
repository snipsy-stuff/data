### 📜 Description
With this spell, the caster causes the creature touched to see its world as a dead and horrific place. The affected target sees all living creatures surrounding it as hideous undead zombies, and the rest of its surroundings as a hellish nightmare. Buildings looked burned and ruined; food looks spoiled; even the sky appears black and ominous. This apocalyptic nightmare is so terrifying he is panicked. A successful disbelief results in the creature being shaken for 1 round.
