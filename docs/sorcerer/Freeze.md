### 📜 Description
A blast of cold air billows around your target, chilling water or moisture around it and freezing it in place. The target is aware and breathes normally, but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

The target may also substitute an Escape Artist check (DC equal to the spell's save DC + 5) to break free of its icy sheath. A frozen winged creature cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer cannot swim and may drown. A target that successfully escapes still loses its next move action.
