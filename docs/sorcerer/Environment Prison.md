### 📜 Description
You create a cocoon-like prison out of surrounding environment, hidden among the natural setting, to hold a subject motionless. While so imprisoned, the target grows no older and its body functions virtually cease. It cannot use any abilities, even purely mental ones. Those affected by the spell must be either helpless or willing (often, when granted the option of this type of imprisonment or death, a target submits to the spell). For up to one hour per day, you can mentally communicate with it, although it is in no way compelled to answer any questions or even respond. Only locate creature or similar divinations can find an imprisoned target. A dispel magic or break enchantment effect can free it.
