### 📜 Description
The caster gains the frightful presence supernatural ability with a range of 30 feet. This ability is triggered when the caster charges, and only affects creatures that have fewer Hit Dice than the spell's caster level. Creatures that are subject to this effect must make a Will save or be shaken for 5d6 rounds. Creatures that make their saves are immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, fear effect.

Furthermore, your manufactured and natural weapons are enhanced, gaining the flaming and flaming burst special qualities. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your existing natural armor bonus (if you have no natural armor you gain natural armor +4). This bonus increases by +1 for every three caster levels above 11th, to a maximum of +7 at 20th level.

Additionally, you gain the supernatural breath weapon special attack. The breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of fire, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures caught within the blast get a Reflex save for half damage. Once the caster has breathed the fire, which is a standard action, he may not do so again for 1d4+1 rounds. Finally, each use of this breath reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 30 minutes. If there are fewer than 30 minutes remaining on the duration, the caster may still breathe but the spell expires immediately afterwards, and the caster is helpless for the following round.
