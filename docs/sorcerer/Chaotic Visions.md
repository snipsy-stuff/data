### 📜 Description
All creatures affected by this spell perceive the world around them as constantly changing. Objects appear or disappear, terrain shifts, sounds are different, and bizarre smells assault the nose. Usually, the world they see is totally different from what is truly around them. Additionally, the magic is insidious enough to distort the memories of their surroundings, so it becomes difficult to even navigate by memory. The only sense that is not affected is touch, so affected creatures still feel damage and can crudely navigate by reaching out to find obstacles.

Also, affected creatures still perceive themselves normally. Once the spell is cast, it continues to affect creatures in the initial area of effect, even if they leave that area. New creatures entering that area are unaffected.

Each affected creature is nauseated, automatically fails any Reflex save, and is effectively blind and deaf. In addition to the obvious effects, it suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus to attacker's attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on initiative and on most Strength- and Dexterity- based skill checks. Unlike normal blindness or deafness, however, the creature can still hear and see itself normally, and so suffers no risk of miscasting spells with verbal components. A successful saving throw negates all the above effects though the subject is sickened for 1 round.

Creatures with true seeing are unaffected. Creatures who gain true seeing after being affected initially suffer no further effects from this spell.
