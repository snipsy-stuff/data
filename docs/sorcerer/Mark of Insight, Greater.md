### 📜 Description
This spell creates a mark of a gold and silver colored eye on the forehead (or other prominent feature) of any creature, living or undead. Those bearing this mark gain a +5 insight bonus to a single saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex or Will) chosen at the time of casting. They also possess the ability to grant themselves a single +25 insight boost to one saving throw (the same saving throw chosen at the time of casting). Using this boost ability is an immediate action that instantly dismisses the greater mark of insight. You cannot possess more than one greater mark of insight at a time.
