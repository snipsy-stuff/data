### 📜 Description
This spell causes the weapon touched to grow to the next smallest size that would normally make it impossible to wield. The damage dealt by the weapon increases as though it were one size category larger, but the weapon can be wielded as though it were its original size. This effect does not stack with other magic effects that increase size, such as enlarge person or righteous might.
