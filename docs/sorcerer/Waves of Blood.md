### 📜 Description
You cause torrents of roiling blood to push your opponents away from you. This wave attempts a bull rush combat maneuver against all creatures within its area of effect, and you bull rush creatures of any size in this way. Attempt a single combat maneuver check and apply the result to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. Any creature in the area must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for 1d6 rounds by the tide of blood.

The area covered by the cone remains slick for 1 round, requiring a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check from any creature attempting to move within it (as if moving on uneven ground). Any creature that falls prone due to failing the check must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened until it stands back up.
