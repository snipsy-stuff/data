### 📜 Description
The caster transfers some of his or her natural armor bonus (up to half the caster's total bonus) to the chosen target, who gains the benefit of it. This natural armor bonus stacks with existing natural armor bonuses that the target may have, but it does not stack with multiple castings of this spell (whether from the same caster or others).
