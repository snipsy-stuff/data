### 📜 Description
You instantly change the appearance of the subjects so they appear as normal trees and maintain that appearance for the spell's duration. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like real trees. If attacked, the illusion is negated on that creature (and that creature only), unless it's you, in which case you must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 14 + damage taken) to maintain the spell. If your check fails, the spell ends, revealing all massmorphed subjects. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on themselves by making Will saves or via spell resistance. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief saves to see through the glamer, but spell resistance doesn't help. True seeing reveals a massmorphed creature.
