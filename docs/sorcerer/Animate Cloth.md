### 📜 Description
You bring a semblance of life to your clothing, making it aid you in combat and otherwise. Your clothing grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to CMB for dirty trick, disarm, grapple, steal, or trip combat maneuvers. The cloth also provides you with a +1 shield bonus to AC. Finally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Climb and Sleight of Hand checks, Perform checks that would benefit from your animated cloth (such as dancing, acting, or physical comedy, at the GM's discretion), and Bluff checks to feint. The animated cloth can only assist you in a single action each round, and you cannot direct the cloth to perform independent actions.

Animate cloth has no effect when you wear medium or heavy armor.
