### 📜 Description
Blood drops fling forth from your hand, unerringly striking affected targets. The blood hangs there for a moment before being absorbed into their bodies. You create a mystic connection between the subjects so that all of them share the same fate. Each time one of the subjects takes damage, that damage is divided evenly among all the subjects of the spell (any remaining damage is dealt to the target of the attack). Special conditions affecting one creature can be elected by a member of the web to affect that member instead as an immediate action. If a creature is killed by shared damage or by another effect, it is simply removed from the link, and damage is thereafter divided among the remaining creatures. The link forged by web of fate is effective regardless of distance, but it cannot cross the boundaries between planes. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subjects, but damage already split is not reassigned. 

Unwilling creatures who make their saves are not linked by this spell. The caster knows which creatures are subject to the spell and which are not at the time of casting. A caster who is one of the spell's subjects knows the location and status of all the others as though using a status spell. No subject, not even the caster, can voluntarily leave the link. This spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a miracle, or wish spell.
