### üìú Description
A solid mass of sticky webbing fills the air as you direct. This spell creates a solid mass of sticky web strands similar to those created by a web spell. It is typically employed to close passages, entrap foes, or bridge gaps. You can place the web wall cubes as you desire, but each cube must have at least one side in contact with the whole side of another cube, and at least one cube must have one whole side in contact with the ground or another very solid surface (a cavern ceiling or castle wall would suffice, but the wall of a grass hut or a pile of sand would not). Thus, a 10th-level caster could make a tower of webbing 100 feet tall and 5 feet on a side or a 20-foot-tall, 5-foot thick wall of webbing 25 feet long; alternatively, she could surround a Huge creature with eighteen 5-foot cubes. 

Creatures caught within the area of the web wall cubes when the spell is cast are automatically entangled. Creatures that merely touch the web wall must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become entangled. 

Creatures that succeed at the Reflex saving throw are not entangled, but moving into or through the webs results in entanglement; entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, by making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.

If you have at least 5-feet of web between you and an opponent, the webbing provides cover. If you have 20  feet of web between you, it provides total cover. 

Unlike a web spell, a web wall can't be so easily destroyed by fire. Each 5-foot cube can sustain up to 50 points of fire damage before being destroyed; all other forms of damage have no effect (althoughdisintegrate affects the web wall normally). 

You and up to six allies designated at the time of casting can move through the web wall as though it weren't there; these creatures are never entangled. They can also climb through the web, along its side, or within it as though using spider climb.
