### 📜 Description
With this spell you magically enhance stones such that when you throw them they transform into giant balls of lava that do not harm you. You treat these as light thrown weapons with which you are proficient. These balls of lava deal 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage plus your caster ability modifier in fire damage. The boulders have a range increment of 60 feet and can be thrown up to 5 range increments. 

The boulders strike as bludgeoning weapons, rather than spells, and are considered magic weapons for purposes of damage reduction. The stones can be enhanced with spells as though they were projectiles. Once a stone strikes (or misses) its target, the magic within it is discharged, and the stone reverts to normal.
