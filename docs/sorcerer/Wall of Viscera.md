### üìú Description
When you cast this spell, you prick yourself with the focus, dealing 1 hp damage. If this damage is somehow prevented or negated, the spell is not cast.

You create a 5-ft.-wide, opaque curtain of undulating, clotting blood. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. You can even create a cylindrical or square wall of viscera to enclose specific points.

Creatures in liquid or gaseous forms cannot pass through the wall (though ethereal or insubstantial ones can), and neither can most gases, liquids, and gas or liquid breath weapons. If the wall is conjured in the same square as a creature that could not pass through it, the creature is immediately and harmlessly shunted to the nearest open space. The squares containing the wall are considered difficult terrain for creatures that can pass through it.

The wall emanates an aura of dread. Any living creature that wishes to pass through the wall of viscera must succeed at a Will save to do so. The save must be made each time the creature wishes to pass through the wall (or remain in the wall if it pauses partway through). This unwillingness is a mind-affecting fear affect.

If a creature with spell resistance attempts to pass through the wall, it must make a level check when it first does so. If the check fails, the creature can ignore the wall's fear effect. When you cast this spell, you may exclude yourself from the fear effect, as well as up to one creature per level if you possess a drop of blood from each creature to be excluded.

Creatures that resist or are immune to the fear effect of this spell still must treat the wall as a physical object that blocks vision, resists liquids and gases, and counts as difficult terrain.
