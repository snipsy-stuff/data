### 📜 Description
You create a poisonous glob of disgusting and pulsating green flesh that thrums with the power of Abyssal corruption, and you lob it at your enemy.

With a successful touch attack, the globule deals 1d4 hp acid damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or become poisoned. This poison deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a Fortitude save each round to end the affliction, but they become sickened for the remaining duration.
