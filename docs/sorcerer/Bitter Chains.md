### 📜 Description
With a successful melee touch attack, the ring you wield bursts into chains of sharp, interlocking rings that envelope the target. The target is entangled while chained. If the target moves more than 5 ft. in a round while under the effect of this spell, it takes 1 hp bleed damage/caster level (maximum 10 hp per round) as the rings dig into the creature.

The target must make a concentration check (DC 15 + the spell's level) to successfully cast a spell while chained. As a full-round action, the target can attempt an Escape Artist check to escape the chains or a Strength check to burst the chains. The DC for these checks is equal to the spell's DC. A successful check escapes the spell. A failed check deals bleed damage as if the creature had moved more than 5 ft.
