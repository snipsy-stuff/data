### üìú Description
Upon casting this spell, the caster causes shadow and darkness to writhe and crawl, like a wave of spiders, striking at those who oppose him and gnawing at their flesh and sanity. Those who are within the initial area of effect must immediately attempt a Will save; if they fail, they are subject to attack from any shadow or area of darkness they enter, whether it be of natural or magical origin. At the beginning of each round they remain in darkness, shadows coalesce and attack, with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level. On a successful strike, the claws deal 1d6 + 1/2 your caster level in slashing damage. This effect follows each victim for the duration of the spell, so that even characters who flee the initial area of effect are subject to attack from creatures of shadow and night. 

In addition to suffering physical injury, victims of this spell are subject to terrifying psychological assault as well. The shadow shapes which appear to gnaw at their bodies are universally horrific in appearance, with lumpy, otherworldly bodies, spade-like claws and mouths full of jagged teeth. They resemble nothing so much as visions from a child's nightmares. For the duration of the spell effect, all those who were within the radius of effect of the spell when it was cast suffer from the Shaken condition.

Victims of this spell can avoid damage by ensuring that they remain entirely out of shadow. This can be difficult to do, as even the victim's own shadow will writhe forth to attack him. A character who is the focal point of a light spell, or other, similar enchantment will not himself cast a shadow, though the aura he radiates may well doom his less fortunate companions.
