### üìú Description
You call upon the power of a demon lord of corruption, which sends a blast of rot and corruption from your body in all directions. This covers everything in a carpet of vile fungal growths, which climb up and over walls if the area of effect is great enough. Creatures caught in the path of crawling corruption must make a Reflex save or be covered by a rapidly growing riot of fungus, becoming entangled. A successful save negates the entangled effect but does not keep the creature from being coated in fungus unless it has evasion or improved evasion. The caster is not affected.

The fungus rapidly breaks down organic materials, causing decay and rot. Creatures in the area of effect must succeed at a Fortitude save or begin to rot away, taking 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage every round. This is a poison effect; creatures immune to poison are unaffected. Unattended objects made of organic materials such as wood, leather, or cloth suffer 4d6 hp damage per round of exposure. This damage ignores hardness.

A full-round action spent scraping away the fungus can remove the effect from a single creature or object of Medium or smaller size. A neutralize poison or heal spell removes the fungus from a creature, object, or up to a 5-ft. section of terrain. The fungus remains until removed or adversely affected by local conditions (e.g. killed by exposure to the sun if cast in a desert environment).Any area coated with fungal growth counts as difficult terrain for purposes of movement and increases the DC of any Acrobatics checks made in the area by 5.
