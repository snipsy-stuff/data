### 📜 Description
The target appears to be slightly farther away than it actually is. If an opponent fails its Will save when interacting with the target, it perceives the creature to be 5 ft. farther away. This enables the target to cast a spell or use a ranged weapon without provoking an attack of opportunity. A creature that believes the illusion will automatically miss if it attempts to attack with a reach weapon.

Additionally, Tiny or smaller creatures appear to be in an adjacent space rather than the same space.
