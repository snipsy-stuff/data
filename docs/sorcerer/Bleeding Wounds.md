### 📜 Description
This spell accelerates injuries with small amounts of negative energy. By infecting the target with a minute amount of negative energy, this spell accelerates injuries to living tissue and makes wounds more serious. Even a small knife wound can be made to bleed more heavily, the flesh around it turning septic as the spell works its dark magic. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray takes an additional 1d6 damage every time it takes damage from any weapon or non-energy damage source (so not from spells that deal energy damage, or breath weapons) for the duration of the spell. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, plants or oozes.
