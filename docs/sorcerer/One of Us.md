### 📜 Description
You forcibly impose the mana-wasted template on the target of this spell, transforming it into a warped and deformed mockery of its true form. In addition, a creature transformed by this spell must succeed at a Will save against the spell’s save DC or else be treated as charmed by you. The target can always understand your speech, even if you do not share a language, it treats you as a trusted friend and ally and you can try to command it as normal for a charmed creature. However, a creature transformed by one of us retains a dim memory of your role in its transformation from something else, with a seed of rage against you ready to be ignited if shocked back to its senses. Whenever a critical hit is confirmed against the target, or whenever it succeeds at a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, it can attempt a DC 20 Will save as a free action to break free of your charm for 1d12 hours. If it ever rolls a natural 20 on such a Will save, the charm is broken permanently the target is affected as vengeful outrage (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic), with its hate directed at you. The charm effect can be dispelled with dispel magic, but it returns after 1d12 hours unless the curse is removed. The physical transformation caused by this spell cannot be dispelled, but can be removed with genetic purification, miracle, or wish.
