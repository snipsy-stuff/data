### 📜 Description
The recipient of this spell gains the speed, agility, and endurance of one of nature's most elusive creatures: the gazelle. For the duration of the spell, the subject's base land speed increases by 10 feet. This increase stacks with any increase granted by class abilities, but not with bonuses from other spells or magic items (such as the expeditious retreat spell or boots of striding and springing). The subject also gains the benefits of the Run feat, as well as gaining a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.
