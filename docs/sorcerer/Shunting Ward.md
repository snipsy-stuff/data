### 📜 Description
This ward greater teleports any creature touching the subject 1d100 x 10 miles away instantaneously in a random direction away from the subject; creatures who make a successful Will save are transported 1d20 + 10 feet in a random direction away from the subject. Creatures using a melee attack against the subject only deal their damage if they succeed on their Will save. Creatures using attended objects to touch the creature are considered to be touching the creature (for example using a 10- foot pole) and only affect the subject with the attended object on a successful Will save. 

The creatures arrive safely in the new destination and are never transported into a solid object or into midair (if these are the only options, the spell does not function). Even if a subject with this ward cast upon it wants to be touched, the spell's effects remain the same. Creatures that touch the warded creature multiple times (even with weapons) must make a saving throw each time. 

If cast on an area, the ward affects anyone entering the area and every creature must make a saving throw each round they are in the area. 

The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A successful dispel magic removes this ward from a specific creature or object but not an area. A successful mage's disjunction destroys the entire shunting ward effect.
