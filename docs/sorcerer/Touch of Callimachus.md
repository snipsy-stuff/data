### 📜 Description
Your touch evokes a raised, bluish glyph on the subject. The target is more susceptible to your spells and takes a -2 penalty to all saves against spells you cast with the penalty, increasing by 1 per 4 levels to a total of -6 at 20th level. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to caster checks to overcome the affected creature's spell resistance, if any.
