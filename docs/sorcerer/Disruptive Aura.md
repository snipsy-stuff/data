### 📜 Description
A warping, prismatic field surrounds and outlines the subjects, causing creatures to take a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks (no save). Additionally, targets must make a Will saving throw each round the spell is in effect. On a failed roll, the target's next spell or use of a spell-like ability or magic item is suppressed, as if affected by a successful, targeted dispel magic spell. If the save is successful, however, the target can cast spells and use spell-like abilities that round as normal.

All spells and spell-like abilities are potentially subject to disruptive aura's suppression. (Because of the nature of ley-infused energy, disruptive aura can affect spells not normally affected by dispel magic.)
