### 📜 Description
By casting this spell and touching the target, you change the target's appearance  to what it was just before the creature died. The target looks, feels, and detects as a healthy, living creature, and it must eat, drink and sleep as a living creature does (although it requires only 2 hours sleep per night). The target can benefit from first aid and long-term care (see the Heal skill) but it also becomes susceptible to poisons (treat the target's Constitution score as 0.)

The target is still destroyed when it reaches 0 hp. Positive energy still harms it, and negative energy heals it as is usual for undead. Any amount of positive energy damage, Constitution damage, or energy drain immediately ends this spell.

This spell can also affect a corpse. In this case, treat as gentle repose, except for the change of appearance. If this spell is cast on an intelligent undead, the target must be willing or it is entitled to a Will save.
