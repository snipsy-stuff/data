### 📜 Description
This spell functions like symbol of death, save that all creatures that come within 60 feet of the activated symbol of hate instead become overwhelmed with hate, turning on the closest creature (friend or foe) and attacking ferociously with intent to kill for a number of rounds equal to the caster level of the symbol. 

Unlike the symbol of death spell, there is no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of hate simply remains active for 10 minutes per level of the caster. 

Note: Magic traps such as symbol of hate are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of hate and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of hate.
