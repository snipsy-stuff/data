### 📜 Description
You brand the target's forehead with a symbol representing "one who is outcast". The victim's mark is noticeable to all and he has an aura of unpleasantness about him. The subject suffers a - 5 penalty on all Charisma-based ability and skill checks except turning undead. The target also takes 1d6 points of damage from the brand. This damage cannot be healed until the curse is removed. The curse can only be removed with a successful caster level check (DC 15+ your caster level) so long as the material component of the spell is whole.
