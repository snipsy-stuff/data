### 📜 Description
You violently hurl one or more objects or creatures into the air. You can hurl one object or creature per every 2 caster levels (maximum 10). You must hurl objects or creatures that are within the spell's range and that are within 40 ft. of each other. The target must be within 400 ft. of all objects thrown.

You can hurl up to a total weight of 50 lbs. per caster level (maximum 1,000 lbs. at 20th level). Objects hurled at moving targets require an attack roll (one per creature or object thrown) to hit, using your base attack bonus plus your Intelligence (if a wizard) or Charisma (if a sorcerer) modifier. You deal 1d4 damage to the target creature per 50 lbs. of the object or creature thrown.

Creatures within the spell's weight capacity can be hurled, but they receive Will saves and spell resistance, if applicable, to negate the effect, as do held objects targeted by the spell. If a catapulted creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes 1d6 hp damage per every 3 caster levels you possess.
