### 📜 Description
You trace a glyph resembling discordant musical notes on the subject's face, granting them the ability to emit a 30-ft. cone of sound as a standard action. Creatures in the area take 7d6 hp sonic damage and are deafened for 3d6 rounds unless they make a successful Fortitude save, which negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Once the subject uses this ability three times, the spell is expended.
