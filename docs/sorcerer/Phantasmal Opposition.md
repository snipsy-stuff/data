### 📜 Description
You create a phantasmal image of the target creature which only it can see, with you and other onlookers discerning only a vague shape. The phantasmal duplicate appears in the subject's space. 

The subject gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal, but if that save fails, the phantasm attacks the subject using its most potent attack (highest-level harmful spell, most potent weapon, and so forth). None of the duplicate's attacks or actions affect anyone but the subject, and none of the duplicate's actions (including its initial appearance) provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful save negates the effects but the target suffers 8d6 points of damage. If the subject moves, the duplicate moves with it. The phantasm and the target creature have the same initiative, but since they have the same Dexterity score as well, the GM will roll each round to see which gets to act first. In this and all other ways, the duplicate functions exactly like the subject, having the same statistics, hit points, and equipment. Any piece of equipment separated from the duplicate immediately reappears in the duplicate's possession. 

If the target creature's save succeeds, the phantasmal duplicate appears in the creature's space but cannot harm or affect it in any way.
