### 📜 Description
This spell temporarily adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don't know the item's abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activate as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item's normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires. It the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.
