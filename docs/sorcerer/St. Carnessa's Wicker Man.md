### 📜 Description
Thorn-covered vines dive in and out of the ground like dolphins racing from your feet toward a target square. Treat this effect as a summoned assassin vine with all the statistics of that creature (Pathfinder Bestiary). The vine appears where you designate once this spell's casting time is complete.

Normally, the vine retreats into the ground when the spell expires. But if a victim dies, the bloodthirsty vines dig through the corpse's veins, fixing it in place until the birds have reduced it to bones trapped in a wicker circulatory system.
