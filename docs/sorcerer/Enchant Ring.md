### üìú Description
You bespell a ring. The next creature that willingly wears the ring regards you as an ally for 1 day/level. The spell is discharged from the ring once it is worn. If the creature is directly threatened by you or your allies when it puts on the ring, this enchantment fails.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the spell. You must speak the creature's language to communicate your commands (or else be good at pantomiming).

This curse can be removed from the ring or the cursed individual by any method that can remove spells with the curse descriptor. A Spellcraft check (DC 25 + your level) identifies the item as cursed.

This effect is subject to spell resistance as soon as the ring is worn. This spell affects magical and non-magical rings, but rings that are intelligence receive a Will save.
