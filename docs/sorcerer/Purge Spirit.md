### 📜 Description
Purge spirit rips away at the target’s spiritual substance, scattering it over a wide area and hampering the target’s ability to reform. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1 round. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not staggered. This spell affects astrally projected creatures, ethereal creatures, haunts, incorporeal creatures, mediums channeling a spirit, and phantoms, and at the GM’s discretion can affect other spirits or creatures made of ectoplasm. Incorporeal creatures take full damage from purge spirit.
