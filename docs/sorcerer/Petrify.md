### 📜 Description
You instantaneously fossilize any organic matter that you touch. Wood, flesh, bone and any other dead material is turned into roughhewn stone, gaining the hardness and hit points of this material; therefore a wooden door or a bone scroll case can be petrified. Unattended objects do not receive saving throws; however, objects worn or carried by another creature, as well as undead and creatures built from any of the aforementioned materials, are entitled to a saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw, it is turned into stone as if it were affected by a flesh to stone spell. Although this spell can affect constructs, it does not circumvent a golem's immunity to magic extraordinary ability.
