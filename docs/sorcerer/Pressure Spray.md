### 📜 Description
You create a line of highly pressurized water to spring forth from your hand. You may use this line to make a ranged touch attack against a single target. If you succeed, you deal 1d6 points of non-lethal damage. Additionally, Medium and Small creatures that fail their Fortitude saves are knocked prone by the blast, and Tiny or smaller creatures are knocked back 1d4 x 10 feet and knocked prone. Each round that you concentrate on the spell you can make an additional attack against either the same target or a new target. As a standard action, you can use the water from the spell to extinguish fires. Mundane fires that cover an area of one 5-ft. square or less are automatically extinguished in one round. Mundane fires of a size greater than five feet are shrunk by a 5-ft. square each round you target them. Magical fires can also be extinguished, but to do so requires a modified caster level check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +5) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell. Elemental (fire) creatures or other creatures that are vulnerable to water take regular damage instead of non-lethal damage.
