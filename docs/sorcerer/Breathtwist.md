### 📜 Description
You change the nature of your energy breath weapon. It deals a different type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) the next time you use it (within one minute). All other parameters of the breath weapon (range, shape, damage, and so on) remain unchanged. This spell is an acid spell when you change your breath weapon to acid, a cold spell when you change it to cold, and so on. This spell has no effect on creatures without a breath weapon. Using a magic item such as a potion of fire breath counts as having a breath weapon.
