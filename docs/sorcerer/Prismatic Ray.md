### üìú Description
A ray of light made of shifting color springs from your hand. Its effect varies depending on which color is dominant when the beam strikes its target; the ray may inflict damage as listed below, or it may impose a condition on the target.

Maximum damage is always 15d6 hp. Conditions inflicted by the green, blue, violet, and multi-colored rays last 1 round per level. A successful save halves the damage or negates the effect, whichever is applicable.

On a critical hit, the caster may choose the color of the beam which hits the target. Otherwise, roll a d8 to determine the ray's effects, as listed below.
