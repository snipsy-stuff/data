### 📜 Description
You extract the knowledge and memories from a target creature within range. The spell drains Intelligence from the subject until only 1 point of Intelligence remains and the target is driven insane as per the insanity spell. The caster is free to draw on all memories and Intelligence-based skills of the victim, using the victim's skill ranks, but modified by the caster's Intelligence, feats, and any other miscellaneous modifiers. After 1 hour the ability to access the victim's Intelligence-based skills ends, but you can still draw upon its other memories with a successful Intelligence check (DC 15).

If the save succeeds, the Intelligence drain is negated, and the caster cannot access its memories or Intelligence-based skills, the victim instead takes 9d6 points of damage and is staggered for 1 round. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is also immune to that same caster's brain drain spell for 24 hours after the staggered condition ends.
