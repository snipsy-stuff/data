### 📜 Description
Jagged shards of bone burst from your hand, dealing 1d6 hp piercing damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within the burst. Living creatures affected by the bone shards also sustain an additional 1d4 hp bleed damage each round. This bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or through the application of any magical healing. The bone shards vanish immediately after hitting or missing their target.
