### üìú Description
This spell has as many different names as there are races that know of it. The ultimate form of social divination, ultimate insight opens the caster to the infinite knowledge of how all life thinks, acts and lives. Everything about life, from its history to its myriad social traditions, is laid bare and revealed in one moment of incredible revelation. While this immense amount of knowledge is short-lived and impossible for a mortal mind to retain for long, it can be put to good use while it lasts. 

A caster under the effect of ultimate insight gains a +20 insight bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saves. 

The power of this spell goes even further. Any task other than combat that this spell applies to can be completed within its duration, no matter how long it would normally take to complete, as long as the caster can dedicate more than half the spell's duration to that task. The sole exception to this is an attempt to chronicle the vast knowledge gained in any way. There is simply far too much information in the caster's mind to allow the kind of concentration required to write down everything he has learned. More narrow topics are acceptable though. 

For example, an 18th level caster could fight warriors for 2 rounds, and spend a vast number of days crafting a flawless suit of magical chain mail.
