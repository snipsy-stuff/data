### 📜 Description
The caster imbues his flesh with a foul appearance and taste, dissuading living creatures from biting him. Anytime a living creature with a bite attack successfully bites a target under the effects of foul flesh it must make a successful Fortitude save or refuse to bite the target again while the spell lasts. A creature that fails its saving throw can still use other attack modes against the caster.
