### 📜 Description
For the duration of this spell, the victim has the unpleasant sensation of being poked and prodded with hundreds of tiny needles. This causes the victim to suffer a -1 circumstance penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks, and requires that he succeed at a Concentration check (with a DC 10 + your caster level) any time that he tries to cast a spell.
