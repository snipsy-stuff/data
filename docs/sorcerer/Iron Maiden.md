### 📜 Description
Iron maiden causes the target's armor to grow rigid and hundreds of tiny spikes to grow on the inside. These spikes stab the target, dealing 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 25d6); the armor remains rigid, rendering the target immobile and helpless for 1 round per level. The spell does not deal damage more than once. A successful save results in half damage and the target being staggered for 1 round. Despite the name, the target creature need not be wearing armor made of iron.
