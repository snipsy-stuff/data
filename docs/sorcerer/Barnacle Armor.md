### 📜 Description
The touched creature grows a colony of encrusting barnacles that provide protection from cuts and slashes.

The subject gains DR 5/bludgeoning. Once the spell has prevented a total of 5 damage/caster level (maximum 50 hp), it is discharged and the encrustation crumbles off.

In addition, the sharp barnacles allow you to deal an extra 1d6 hp piercing damage on a successful grapple attack. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the barnacles, and they count as a light simple weapon in this case, although you can't also make an attack with them if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.

The barnacles provide a +5 to Escape Artist checks to escape soft bonds that can be cut, such as ropes.
