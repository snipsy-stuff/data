### 📜 Description
The recipient gains an extra head, which is made from shadowflesh and sprouts from the creature's shoulders. This extra head can  deliver bite attacks as the base creature (either a tiger, panther, viper, cobra, or jackal). The target makes this bite attack as a primary natural weapon, with a bonus equal to its own base attack bonus. The bite attack always deals 1d6 hp damage/2 caster levels (max 5d6). The recipient cannot be flanked while the spell is in effect.

For every 4 caster levels you possess, this spell produces a further head (maximum of 5 heads). All bite attacks are primary natural weapons, meaning you can make attacks with all of them as part of a standard attack action.
