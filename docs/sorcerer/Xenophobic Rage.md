### 📜 Description
Your victims suffer from an insane rage making them instantly aggressive to anyone not of their own type and subtype. Elves will not attack a humanoid (elf), but they do attack the nearest non-humanoid (elf) in the area. The victims use all of their skills to the best of their ability to destroy these enemies. Those targets fortunate enough to make their Will saves are still affected as if by a confusion spell for 1 round but are immune to subsequent castings of this spell from the same caster for 24 hours. 

Remove curse does not remove xenophobic rage. Greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can restore the creature. Heal and limited wish, however, only grant a second saving throw, if this save is not successful further castings have no effect.
