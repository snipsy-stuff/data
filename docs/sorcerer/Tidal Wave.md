### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, you call a massive wave from the nearby ocean to crash on land. The wave is 200 ft. wide and inundates an area inland within 50 ft. plus 5 ft./level of the shore.

Creatures caught in the wave take 1d6 hp bludgeoning damage/level (maximum 20d6) at the moment of impact. They also must make a Swim check each round the spell lasts (DC equal to this spell's) to stay above water. At the end of the spell, unsecured objects and creatures caught in the wave are pulled back out to sea unless they make a Reflex save. The distance equals half the distance the wave came inland. Buildings and objects caught in the wave take 100 hp damage at the moment of impact.
