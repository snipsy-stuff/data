### 📜 Description
This spell generates random, subconscious thoughts in the creature targeted. The target creature is unaware of the thoughts generated, but anyone attempting to read the creature's mind hears only gibberish or static.

This spell grants a circumstance bonus equal to 15 + your level to saves against any divination spell that doesn't normally grant a save, such as locate creature. It grants a +4 resistance bonus to divination spells that do allow a save, such as detect thoughts. The spell also grants a +2 resistance bonus to saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects.

The spell does not grant any bonus or resistance against limited wish, miracle, or wish spells when they are used to scry on or otherwise gain information about the target of the spell.
