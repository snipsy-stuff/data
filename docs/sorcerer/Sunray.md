### 📜 Description
You gather the ambient light from your surroundings and focus it into a scorching beam dealing 2d8 fire damage on a ranged touch attack; undead creatures suffer 4d8 points of fire damage from this beam. You can make one attack with the beam as a free action in the round you cast the spell and then make one attack as a standard action each round for as long as the spell lasts.
