### 📜 Description
The subject of this spell can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or traverse ceilings as easily as a gecko does. The affected creature must have at least one hand free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed equal to its base speed and a +8 competence bonus to Climb checks; the target of the spell does not need to make Climb checks to cross a vertical or horizontal surface, including upside down. The subject retains its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. The subject of the spell can use the run action while climbing as a full-round action.
