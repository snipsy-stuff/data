### 📜 Description
Shadowy cohort creates the illusion of a ominous Medium-sized warrior (AC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier) under your command. The sentinel may be commanded to do anything you wish as it serves as an extension of your intelligence, skills and personality, remaining utterly loyal to you. The sentinel has a BAB equal to your and adds your associated stat bonus (an 18th level sorcerer with a Charisma of 19 creates a sentinel with a BAB of +18, and an attack of +12). It inflicts 2d8 plus 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +25). The cohort is discharged after being successfully struck for 12 points of damage per caster level (maximum 300), it uses your saving throws.
