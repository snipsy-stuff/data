### üìú Description
If you know the name of the spell, subschool or descriptor that bypasses the golem's magic immunity that you touch, this spell takes on that spell's name, subschool, or descriptor and uses that opening to transform the body of a golem so that another creature touched can merge and gain control of the golem. For example, if cast on a stone golem it would be considered a stone to flesh spell for purposes of bypassing its magic immunity. If you don't know what bypasses the creature's magic immunity, the spell fails as if it failed to overcome the creature's spell resistance. The controlling creature loses all special abilities and benefits of magic items but can share all of its feats and skills with the construct. The controller is immune to all attack forms except for mind-affecting, negative energy, and death effects, although the subject gains the benefits of the magic immunity the golem possesses. 

All other attack forms affect the golem first, and any effect left over after the golem is destroyed is then applied to the controller with all appropriate saves and resistances applied. 

The controller must be one size category smaller than the golem in order to be affected by this spell. If a golem has the swallow whole ability then the ability loses available space equal to the size category of the controller; creatures swallowed cannot attack the merged creature. A golem always resists this spell, and when the spell ends, the creature merged with the golem is expelled.
