### üìú Description
You create a 15-foot-radius emanation centered on the target, which can move if placed on a creature or a movable object. The emanation acts on both air and water, creating an area where the two mix in roughly equal portions. Water within the emanation becomes suffused with bubbles of air, creating an area where air-breathing creatures can breathe normally, while air within the emanation becomes a very wet mist where water-breathing creatures can breathe normally. The spell does not affect any contaminants that may be suspended in the affected air or water, such as poison gases, silt, or smoke. Likewise, the spell does not function in a vacuum, nor will it affect any magical liquid or any nonmagical liquid that is not at least 75% water. Underwater, the emanation creates an environment that functions partly as a land area and partly as a water area. All the normal rules governing underwater combat apply except as noted here.

‚Ä¢ The emanation functions as difficult terrain for any creature swimming through it. Each square of swimming movement counts as two squares moved (three squares for each diagonal).

‚Ä¢ Creatures with land speeds make all melee attacks normally provided that both they and their opponents are within the emanation.

‚Ä¢ Creatures without land speeds suffer a -2 penalty on melee attacks if they or their targets are within the area.

‚Ä¢ When an attacker inside the emanation attacks a target outside (or vice versa) the target has cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) unless the attacker has a land speed and is under a freedom of movement effect (as the spell).

‚Ä¢ A creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) can choose any square that it occupies to determine if it is inside or outside the emanation. Similarly, when attacking such a creature, the attacker can pick any of the squares the defender occupies to determine if is inside or outside the emanation.

On land, the emanation's damp fog can obscure vision (including darkvision). If line of sight to a creature or object passes through 10 to 15 feet of fog, the subject has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). If line of sight passes through more than 15 feet of fog, the subject has total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Less than 10 feet of fog has no effect. Unattended objects and points in space receive no saving throw against this spell, nor does any spell resistance for the object or area apply. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the effects if it or its equipment is the target of the spell, and any spell resistance the creature or object has must be overcome by the caster. Once the spell is in place, though, spell resistance will not negate the effects of the emanation for creatures or objects within it.
