### 📜 Description
You angle your body into and out of an alternate dimension in quick succession. Your outer surfaces (and those of your equipment) disappear and reappear in a disturbing peeling effect that reveals inner layers, including your musculature and circulatory systems. At times, parts of your body disappear entirely. At other times, they reappear as roiling layers of disjointed innards that merge and split apart with lightning speed.

While under the effects of this spell, physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance and spells that individually target you have a 50% chance to fail. You take only half damage from area-of-effect attacks. You also have a 50% chance of ignoring solid objects during each move action. Force effects and abjurations affect you normally.

Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and enemies retain their Dexterity bonus to their AC against your attacks. You receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls and cannot be flanked, but opponents' piercing and slashing weapons have a 50% chance per attack of being treated as keen due to your exposed organs.

The Blind-Fight feat does not help your opponents because you are in an alternate dimension and not merely invisible. Your senses while you are affected by this spell remain perfectly intact.
