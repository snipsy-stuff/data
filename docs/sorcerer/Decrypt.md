### 📜 Description
You gain insight into an encrypted message. This spell gives you a +5 circumstance bonus to one Linguistics skill check you might need to interpret or read a document. While this doesn't insure success, it does make the interpretation of encrypted messages much easier. This spell can be specifically used to counter the encrypt spell if you know the command word, and it automatically removes encryption created by the spell (though this doesn't make the language it was written in any easier to interpret) when you state the command word along with its casting.
