### 📜 Description
This spell allows its subject to look into any mundane shadow within 30 feet + 5 feet/caster level and peer out of the same shadow as if he was standing in that shadow looking in any direction he chose. Therefore, he could look into a nearby shadow and see out of another part of that shadow around a corner, beyond an obstacle, behind himself, or at any distance so long as there is an uninterrupted connection between the point in the shadow he’s looking into and the point he wants to look out from. While under the effect of the spell, the subject can shift back and forth between normal vision and shadow sight as a free action.
