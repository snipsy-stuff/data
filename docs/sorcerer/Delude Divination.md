### üìú Description
Divinations cast on the target are scrambled, giving random results to effects that detect auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like). If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast the delude divination. If successful, the divination works normally for its duration. Otherwise, the divination is nullified, giving random results each minute. For spells that detect presence or absence, there is a 50% chance for either possibility, rolled each minute that the divination is focused on the target. For spells that determine intensity, roll 1d6.

d6    Indicated result 
1      Non-existent 
2      Dim (or Faint if this category does not normally exist for the divination) 
3      Faint 
4      Moderate 
5      Strong 
6      Overwhelming

This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like).
