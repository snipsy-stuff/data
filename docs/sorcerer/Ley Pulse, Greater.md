### 📜 Description
This spell functions like lesser ley pulse, though with a greater area of effect and removing one immunity from each target creature within the burst's area of effect. Additionally, the caster may target up to two of each affected creatures' defensive abilities with this spell. If the creature makes its Will save, none of its defensive abilities are removed.
