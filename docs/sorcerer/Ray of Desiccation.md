### 📜 Description
You fire a desiccating ray that drains the water from a target on a successful ranged touch attack roll. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 9th (to a maximum of three rays at 17th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The rays must be fired at different targets and are fired simultaneously. The target suffers 1d6+1/2 levels (max 1d6+5) damage to its Constitution score. The subject's Constitution score cannot drop below 1. Oozes and creatures with the aquatic or water subtype are particularly susceptible, suffering 1d6+1/level (max. 1d6+10) damage to their Constitution score and their Constitution score can drop below 1 (resulting in death). Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this spell.
