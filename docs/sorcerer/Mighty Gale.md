### üìú Description
You call forth a mighty cone of winds that batter all creatures and obstacles in its path. Against creatures and moveable objects this wind acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own.

Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

To destroy immovable objects or structures in the cone, you must make a Strength check. The winds have an effective Strength equal to your level plus your best ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the object you're trying to break-see breaking items in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook.

Mighty gale extinguishes any fires it encounters along its path. Magical fires from a spell or effect of 4th level or below are also extinguished. Magical fires from a spell or effect of 5th level or higher are unaffected.
