### 📜 Description
After casting this spell, gravity reverses for you and all of your equipment. You fall upwards at the normal rate. You continue to fall until the duration ends, or something stops your fall (such as a ceiling, ropes, etc.). You may act normally upside down. Any items that leave your possession are affected by gravity normally, and any item that enters your possession has its gravity reversed. Once the duration of the spell ends, you fall gently at a rate of 60 feet for one round and suffer no damage if you reach the ground. After that you fall normally.
