### 📜 Description
Your hands become claws, and you gain two claw attacks at your base attack bonus (plus any applicable modifiers). If you already have claws, you gain the ability to rend if you hit with two or more claws. The claws granted by this spell deal damage equivalent to a normal claw attack (1d3 for Small casters, 1d4 for Large casters) plus 1 1/2 x your Strength modifier.
