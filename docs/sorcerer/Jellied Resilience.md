### 📜 Description
The spell's subject becomes a sentient jelly, though it retains its original shape (humanoid or otherwise). This transmutation does not hinder the target in any way. The target becomes immune to critical hits and sneak attacks and gains DR 5 (but only against slashing and piercing damage). If the caster has a level of 10 or greater, the DR increases to 10 against slashing and piercing damage. Additionally, your natural attacks and/or unarmed strikes gain the acidic weapon quality.
