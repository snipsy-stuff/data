### 📜 Description
You disturb the currents of time to destabilize your target area, creating a swirling vortex of temporal energy. A creature in the area is subject to one of the following effects for that round, determined by rolling on the following table at the start of the creature's turn.

Table 2-16: Time Vortex Effects
1-30      The target can only move at half speed for 1 round.
31-60    The target is staggered for 1 round.
61-90    The target is subject to slow for 1 round.
91-100  The target is subject to temporal stasis for 1 round.

The target can make a Will save each round to avoid the effect, but is subject to the spell each round he or she begins in the area.
