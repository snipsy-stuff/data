### 📜 Description
Corporeal instability causes the target's body to destabilize into an amorphous, ever-shifting mass. The creature's body melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, helmets, and backpacks become useless. Large items - armor, backpacks, even shirts - hamper more than help, reducing the creature's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the creature cannot act coherently, attacking blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty to hit and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). At the end of the spell's duration, it returns to its normal form. A creature can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a new save. A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, it can repeat the check each round until successful.
