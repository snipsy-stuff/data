### 📜 Description
You literally "take the subject's breath away" by stealing the air from its lungs. Each round the subject must make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check). If the subject fails a Constitution check, it falls unconscious (0 hp). On the next round, the subject drops to -1 hit points and is dying. On the third round, the subject suffocates and dies. 

A creature that is unable to breathe is also unable to speak and cannot cast spells with a verbal component or communicate verbally with others.
