### 📜 Description
For each of this spell's recipients, the spell creates a pair of Medium-sized axes that whirl about the recipient's head. During a recipient's turn, he or she may direct the axes to attack as a move action. The axes attack separately with an attack bonus equal to the target's base attack bonus plus your Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is greater). The axes bypass damage reduction as magic weapons and deal slashing damage as a battleaxe (1d8/x3). The axes may participate in attacks of opportunity.
