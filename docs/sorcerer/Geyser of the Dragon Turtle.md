### 📜 Description
This spell causes a geyser of steaming water to spring forth from any large body of water within range, such as a cistern, pond, lake, sea, or ocean but not a bucket or bathtub. The geyser is a cone that does 1d6 hp fire damage per 3 levels. It shoves targets that fail a Reflex save away from the spell's point of origin as if they were bull rushed by the caster, but with a +8 circumstance bonus to their CMB. No size adjustments apply.
