### üìú Description
This spell causes the target object to shed darkness in a 60-foot radius so thick that even air has trouble passing through it. The darkness is impenetrable to normal vision, lowlight vision, and darkvision. It also stifles sounds, smells, and vibrations, thus blocking abilities (such as scent, tremorsense, and blindsense or blindsight) that rely on any of the five senses (but not those that rely on telepathic powers or other supernatural means such as lifesense). Any creature that cannot see is blinded. A creature that cannot hear is deafened. Additionally, the thickness of the darkness actually makes it hard to breathe. A character must take a standard action each round to focus on breathing, or she does not get enough oxygen. A character can go without proper oxygen a number of rounds equal to twice her Constitution score. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check in order to continue functioning without breathing. The save must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.

When a character fails a Constitution check, she begins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hit points). This spell does not hamper the air enough to make death a possibility. A character who spends a full round doing nothing but breathing refills her lungs enough so that the rounds without oxygen are discounted. A character who breathes and takes a move action does not regain any breath, but is not penalized for that round.

Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of 6th level of lower. Light spells of 7th level or higher dispel the choking darkness.

If choking darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed. As a darkness spell, choking darkness dispels or counters any light spell of equal or lower level.
