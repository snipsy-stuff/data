### 📜 Description
You create a swarm of maggots from dead flesh up to the size of a Medium humanoid's corpse-even cooked meat is subject to this spell. These maggots cause no damage but immediately begin to devour any dead matter they touch. This effect is most often used to strip meat from bones, to destroy remains so that they cannot be raised from the dead, or to terrify guests at the dinner table. In 1 hour, the maggots can consume an amount of flesh equal to an additional Medium humanoid's corpse.
