### üìú Description
You cloak yourself in a cosmic curtain, your silhouette filled with inky blackness and swirling celestial bodies. While your outline is unchanged, the details of your appearance cannot be seen while so glamered. Attacks against you have a 20% miss chance, though you do not gain actual concealment. You gain lowlight vision and if outdoors at night you gain fast healing 2.

The shroud of stars renders you immune to effects with the light or darkness descriptor, whether they target you or affect an area, as well as pattern spells, searing light, and prismatic spray. In addition, if a spell of these types includes you in its area of effect, as an immediate action you can make a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 plus the caster level of the effect. With a successful check, the entire effect is harmlessly absorbed by the shroud of stars. However, this reduces the remaining duration of the shroud of stars by a number of rounds equal to the level of the absorbed spell. You can attempt to absorb existing effects of these types as a standard action, but the DC is increased to 15 plus the creator‚Äôs caster level. The shroud of stars also protects you from the harmful effects of prismatic wall and prismatic sphere, and a successful caster level check against a DC of 15 plus the caster level of the prismatic wall or prismatic sphere‚Äôs creator enables you to pass through the prismatic sphere or prismatic wall as the caster can. This reduces the remaining duration of the shroud of stars by 10 rounds.
