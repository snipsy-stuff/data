### üìú Description
You cause a column of pyroclastic material to spring forth from any horizontal surface, knocking over creatures directly over it and exposing nearby creatures to the flow as its spray falls back to the ground. 

Any creature entering the pyroclastic vent, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 6d6 points of damage (half bludgeoning, half fire) from the pyroclastic flow and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the vent (e.g., if the geyser is 130 feet tall, the creature takes 13d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the vent. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the pyroclastic vent (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). 

This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement. 

In addition, the geyser sprays pyroclastic material in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the pyroclastic vent's height (e.g., a 130-foot geyser has a 65-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 bludgeoning damage each round as burning rocks cascade on them. 

You can choose to make a smaller vent than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of pyroclastic rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height pyroclastic vent spell.
