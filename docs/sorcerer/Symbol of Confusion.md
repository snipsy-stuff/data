### 📜 Description
This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of the symbol are confused instead. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of confusion has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of confusion simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

Note: Magic traps such as symbol of confusion are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of confusion and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for symbol of confusion.
