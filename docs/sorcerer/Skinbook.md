### üìú Description
Using a process known only to ink magic scriveners, you may inscribe an ink magic cipher or spell on your skin to serve as a scroll or as a recorded spell in a spellbook. A Medium-sized caster may record up to 24 spell levels on their bodies (by shaving all body hair), while Small casters may record up to 12 spell levels on their bodies. For example, recording a 9th level spell requires nine spell levels, leaving the caster with 15 spell levels for recording on their body. If used together with illusory script, the spell or scroll is invisible to all but the caster.

If recorded as a spell, the script must be tattooed or scratched into the flesh and made permanent. The caster treats any such recorded spell as if they had the Spell Mastery feat for that spell, and daily preparation of that spell is instantaneous. Further, any such recorded spell may be instantly swapped for another memorized spell of equivalent level.

If recorded as a scroll, black henna is typically used and the cost is calculated as normal for making a scroll. Casting a scroll recorded on one's skin this way can be done as a swift action.

Damage to one's skin through cutting, slashing, or fire prevents use of the skin-recorded spell until that flesh is healed, while skin-recorded scrolls may be destroyed this way. Skin-recorded spells are permanent but may be changed by using erase to remove them. Skin-recorded scrolls dissipate upon use. Dispel magic destroys a skin-recorded scroll but has no effect on a skin-recorded spell.
