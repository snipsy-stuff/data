### 📜 Description
Hesitate causes a number of creatures in the area to hesitate and second-guess their actions. 

Affected creatures go last in the initiative order and ignore the first attack of opportunity they could take in each round. If more than one creature is affected by hesitate their relative initiative order remains the same relative to one another even though as a group they are moved to the end of the order.
