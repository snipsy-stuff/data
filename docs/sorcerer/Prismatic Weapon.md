### 📜 Description
You transform a single prismatic effect (such as a prismatic spray, wall, or sphere) into the semblance of a melee weapon (the type of weapon is chosen by you at the time of casting) that only you can safely wield; you are automatically proficient with this weapon. With a successful touch attack against an opponent, you inflict all the effects of a prismatic spray (with the appropriate saves and spell resistance checks as per that spell). If you release the weapon, you automatically dismiss the spell.
