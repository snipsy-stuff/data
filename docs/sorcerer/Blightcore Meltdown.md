### üìú Description
You create a coruscating mass of blightburn crystal that pulsates with a bright green radiance, casting deadly emanations throughout the area. Each round a creature begins its turn within the blightcore meltdown, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or contract blightburn sickness.

Blightburn Sickness: contact; save initial save DC is equal to the spell‚Äôs save DC; subsequent saves are Fortitude DC 22; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage and 1d6 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Creatures protected by a force effect take only half damage and gain temporary immunity to blightburn sickness for a number of rounds equal to the spell level of the force effect they are using. After this time, the blightburn radiation penetrates the force effect and creatures within are exposed to full damage and blightburn sickness, though they gain a +4 bonus to their saving throw against contracting the disease. If a creature is using multiple force effects, add the total spell levels of all force effects to determine how long it will take the blightburn radiation to penetrate.

The presence of the blightcore meltdown interferes with teleportation effects of all kinds, including not only actual teleportation but also planar travel and calling and summoning effects. Any such effect cast within‚Äîor cast so as to cause creatures to appear within‚Äîthe area of a blightburn meltdown requires a caster level check against a DC of 15 plus your caster level or the effect fails.

Finally, a blightcore meltdown greatly enhances polymorph effects or effects that alter the size of a living target within the area. The targets of such effects take a -4 penalty on their saving throws, while creatures casting such effects gain a +4 bonus to caster level checks to overcome spell resistance. Such effects are more tenacious and difficult to remove as well, increasing the DC of caster level checks to dispel or remove such effects by 4.
