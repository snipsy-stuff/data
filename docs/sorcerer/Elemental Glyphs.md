### 📜 Description
You call forth a brightly glowing glyph of white energy, plus one additional glyph for every four levels beyond 3rd.

The glyphs orbit your body in a dazzling display for 1 round/level. As a standard action, you can send a single glyph streaking forth as a ranged touch attack to target a foe within range, dealing 3d6 damage of either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, chosen as you unleash the glyph. Once either all of the glyphs are expended in this manner, or the duration ends, the spell is ended.
