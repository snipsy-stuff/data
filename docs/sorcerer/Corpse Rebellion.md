### 📜 Description
With the help of this spell, the once-living spirit of an undead creature tries to regain control of its body. This functions as the confused condition, affecting the undead creature. In addition, if the "act normally" result is rolled and the spirit of the creature would be opposed to being undead, it instead deals damage to itself as if it had rolled that result instead. If the undead fails its Will save, it receives a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect. Mindless undead creatures take a -4 penalty on their saving throws against this spell.
