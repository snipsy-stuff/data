### 📜 Description
You hurl a tiny ball of negative energy, destroying plant life either in a line 60 feet long or a 10-foot-radius spread. This effect removes the cover and concealment provided by trees and undergrowth, eliminates the movement penalties associated with undergrowth, and so forth.

You may also target a single plant creature with this spell. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. An affected plant creature takes 2d8 points of damage.
