### 📜 Description
With a long hissing whisper, you transform all the targeted foe's currently attended weapons into various sorts of snakes that immediately attack your foes. As long as the snakes remain within sight, you can direct their actions telepathically as a free action. Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes take up more than one of your available total, as noted below. Snake statistics can be found in the Pathfinder Bestiary; details on the advanced and giant simple templates can be found within that book as well.

Venomous Snake: Counts as 1 snake.
Constrictor Snake: Counts as 2 snakes.
Advanced Venomous Snake: Counts as 2 snakes.
Advanced Constrictor Snake: Counts as 3 snakes.
Advanced Giant Venomous Snake: Counts as 4 snakes.
Advanced Giant Constrictor Snake: Counts as 5 snakes.
