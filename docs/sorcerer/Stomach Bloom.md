### 📜 Description
This spell causes the target creature's stomach to fill with unwholesome acidic fluid. On the first round and every 1d4 rounds after that, the subject must make a Fortitude save or be sickened and spew the contents of its stomach into a random adjacent square, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage/2 caster levels divided between the subject and the creatures in the affected square. In addition, all creatures in other adjacent squares take 1 point of splash damage/2 caster levels. A successful save negates the sickened condition and the spewing until the spell triggers again.
