### 📜 Description
You let a fragment of a demon's tainted essence transform your body into something demon-like, although it keeps the same rough shape. You suffer a -4 penalty to Diplomacy and Bluff checks, but you gain a +6 bonus on Intimidate checks. You gain immunity to electricity and poison and resist 10 to acid, cold, and fire. Although your alignment does not change, for the duration of this spell you gain the evil subtype and an evil alignment for the purposes of spell, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and magic item effects.

You can cast this spell up to three times without gaining notice from the powers of the Abyss. Upon casting it a fourth time and beyond, there is a 10% cumulative chance you will attract the notice of an Abyssal lord, which will send minions to either attempt to slay or corrupt you. The minion and the power involved in such a task is entirely up to the GM.
