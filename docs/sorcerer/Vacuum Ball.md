### 📜 Description
When this spell is cast, a sound of rushing air surrounds a 1-foot-diameter sphere of nothingness that appears above your outstretched hands. Once created, you determine range and height for the vacuum ball's implosion, hurling it along a line between you and the target point. 

Within 15 feet of the line between you and the point of implosion, all creatures and unattended objects are pulled inward 5 feet. If any creature so moved is pulled into a space adjacent to the path of the vacuum ball, the ball implodes there. Unattended objects pulled adjacent to the path of the ball do not cause it to implode, but are sucked into the vacuum and forever lost. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. When the ball implodes, all creatures within 20 feet are pulled 5 feet toward the center of the implosion. All those in the area, including objects, take 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). A successful Reflex save halves the damage.
