### 📜 Description
When the caster is killed or destroyed all targets within range of the spell at the time of the caster's death or destruction suffer 10 points of damage per caster level. A successful save results in the target suffering 10d6 points of damage instead. A creature slain by this spell has its body completely consumed. The spell's discharge occurs based solely on the caster's death or destruction, regardless of whether the caster wants it to. You can use only one curse of the pyrrhic victory spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is negated.

The curse of the pyrrhic victory cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a miracle, or wish spell.
