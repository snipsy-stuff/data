### 📜 Description
A shimmering, magical whip appears in your hand, as multihued as a rainbow. When used to strike an enemy's touch AC as a standard action, it randomly inflicts a condition on that enemy for one round. To determine the condition, roll 1d10. The whip inflicts a different condition every time it successfully strikes an enemy, even if it strikes the same enemy more than once.
