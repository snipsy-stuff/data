### 📜 Description
You radiate a magical aura that damages any aberrations, outsiders, or undead that come within 30 feet of you. These creatures take 2d6 points of damage every round they stay within your radius of effect, and outsiders must pass a Will save to remain within the radius after taking damage. This spell stacks with any other aura-type abilities you may be using, and denies undead within its radius the advantages of desecration.
