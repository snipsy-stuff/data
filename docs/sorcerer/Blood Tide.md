### 📜 Description
When you cast this spell, the targeted creature begins bleeding from its nose, eyes, ears, and mouth.

This bleeding causes no damage but imposes a -2 penalty on all Intelligence-, Charisma-, and Wisdom-based checks while in effect.

A bleeding creature might also inadvertently attract the attention of creatures such as stirges, sharks, or giant mosquitoes, depending on the circumstances.

A cure minor wounds or DC 10 Heal check can stop the bleeding created by this spell.

Addition from Blood Tide: Causes greater penalties, more bleed damage.
