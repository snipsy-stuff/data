### üìú Description
This spell must be cast in the round directly after you have cast another spell with a non-permanent and noninstantaneous duration. At the completion of the spell, you fall into a deep coma-like sleep. Your body functions cease and you do not grow older. You are unaware of your surroundings and devoid of your senses. 

You are considered helpless while under the effects of this spell. The purpose of this sleep is to extend the duration of the spell cast directly before sleep of power. The first spell lasts as long as you remain in the coma. You set the conditions for when you want to wake up; the first spell then ends. 

The conditions you set must be clear, although they can be general. If you describe complicated or convoluted conditions, you may miscast the spell and never wake up again. The first spell is empowered by the slow leeching of your own life force (represented by Constitution drain). For example, you cast a prismatic wall, which normally lasts for 10 minutes per caster level. In the following round, you cast sleep of power with the condition to wake up when the seventh wall of the prismatic wall is destroyed. You fall into a coma for days, years or even centuries. When the seventh prismatic wall is destroyed, you wake up. 

If you are successfully attacked, you wake up, and the associated spell ends immediately. 

After one month, you lose 1 point of Constitution. Thereafter, the rate slows, requiring an additional month for each point loss (i.e. 1 point the first month, a second point after two more months, a third point after three more months, etc.) If your Constitution score falls to 0 as a result of this spell, you die, and the associated spell ends. These lost ability score points can only be restored by a caster of higher level than you were at the time you cast sleep of power.
