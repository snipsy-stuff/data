### 📜 Description
You conjure a malevolent, silver sphere that you direct to attack your foes. The Tiny sphere has 85 hp, AC 23 (touch 19, flat-footed 16), and CMD 15. It has a fly speed of 90 ft. (perfect).

When it is summoned, the sphere can appear with a metal whip that has a 10-ft. reach and deals 2d6 hp damage or with a serrated blade that deals 2d8 hp damage and has a 5-ft. reach. The sphere can only use one weapon at a time, but it can change weapons as a move action for you that provokes an attack of opportunity on the sphere. The sphere attacks with a bonus equal to your BAB, and each of its weapons act as +1 wounding adamantine weapons. It also receives any iterative attacks you have with the appropriate bonus applied.

As a move action, you can direct the sphere to move to and attack a designated opponent. Once you cease concentrating on the spell, or once the sphere leaves the spell's range, it continues to attack its most recently designated foe until the spell's duration expires or you dismiss the sphere. If a foe is helpless or disabled, it performs a coup de grace.

If you cease concentrating and the sphere no longer has an opponent to attack, it does nothing. You must be within range of the sphere to dismiss it.
