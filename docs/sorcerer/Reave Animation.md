### 📜 Description
A single construct or corporeal undead creature is reaved of its animating magic rendering it permanently inert and helpless if a successful Will save is not made. A construct or corporeal undead under another creature's direct control can use its own Will save bonus or its master's Will save bonus, whichever is higher. A successful Will save results in 5d6 points of damage to the target creature.
