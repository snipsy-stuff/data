### 📜 Description
You create a 2-ft.-diameter, ice-blue cloud that floats in the air. You direct the cloud as a free action to move anywhere within range, making one ranged touch attack each round with your own attack bonus. Those touched by the cloud suffer 3d6 points of cold damage and must make a Fortitude save. Failing the save freezes the victim solid (rendering the victim helpless). Frozen creatures remain alive but cannot take actions. They stay frozen until they suffer 20 points of fire damage, after which point they are free (but sustain the 20 points of damage). If the cloud suffers 10 points of fire damage, the spell ends (the cloud has AC 12).
