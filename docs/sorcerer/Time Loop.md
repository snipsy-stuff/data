### 📜 Description
You capture the target in a loop of time. The target must repeat the actions it took the round prior to being affected by this spell to the best of its ability. For example, if the target used all of its actions to move, it must do so again on the following round, although the direction of the move is up to the target.

If the target cannot perform the same action-for example, the only available potion bottle is empty, the memorized spell is expended, or the target of its attack is no longer within reach-then the target loses that action and cannot take one in its place. If the target succeeds on the Fortitude save, then it does not have to repeat its previous action but instead is staggered for 1 round.
