### üìú Description
Not only can the spellcaster detect the surface thoughts of individuals through this spell, but he can also discern information on thoughts that the target has on specific subjects. The amount of information gathered on the thoughts of a target depends on how long the particular subject is studied under this spell.

‚Ä¢ 1st Round: Information on the surface thoughts of the target. The target must have an Intelligence score of 1 or greater for this spell to work. A Will save by the target prevents you from reading its thoughts, and prevents you from gaining any information with this casting of crystal probe. If the Will save is successful, the target has felt the presence of something looking into its mind and will act appropriately. If this save is not successful the caster of crystal probe can continue looking for thoughts.

‚Ä¢ 2nd Round: The caster can find thoughts on any one subject matter the target has had within the last month. A Will save is no longer possible.

‚Ä¢ 3rd Round: The caster can find thoughts on any one subject matter the target has had within the last year. This does not have to be the same subject as in the 2nd round. A Will save is no longer possible

‚Ä¢ 4th and every round after: The caster can find thoughts on any one subject matter the target has had in its lifetime. This does not have to be the same subject as in previous rounds. A Will save is no longer possible. All thoughts that are found show themselves inside the gem, which the caster can see.

Note: Each round, the caster can choose to probe a new target. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
