### 📜 Description
You conjure a solid surface (up to a 40-ft. square) of slippery, highly acidic grease that can make creatures in the area slip and burn their flesh. Any creatures caught in the area must make a Reflex save or fall prone. A creature can walk within or through the area at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means the creature can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means the creature falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Immobile creatures do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.

Creatures that fall in the area and unattended objects touching the grease take 1d6/caster level hp acid damage (maximum 15d6). On your turn in each of the next 2 rounds, creatures and objects that have taken acid damage take an additional 1d6 hp acid damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 8d6) unless the acid is neutralized, dispelled, or washed away.
