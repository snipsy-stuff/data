### 📜 Description
The subject's age category becomes venerable. His age in years is the minimum threshold for a venerable creature, so an elf affected by this spell would be 350 years old. The transformation reduces an old creature's Strength, Dexterity and Constitution by -3 while increasing his Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma by +1. The Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores of a middle-aged creature are reduced by -5 while his Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma are increased by +2. Creatures that have not reached middle age suffer the most. Their Strength, Dexterity and Constitution are reduced by -6 while their Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma improve by +3. Venerable creatures as well as dragons, ageless, and immortal beings are unaffected by this spell. 

A successful save results in the creature becoming middle age -1 to Str, Dex, and Con; +1 to Int, Wis, and Cha for 1 round per caster level. Middle aged and older creatures are unaffected by this effect.
