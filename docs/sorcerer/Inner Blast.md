### üìú Description
You cause one object to explode, potentially destroying the object and spraying debris into those nearby. The explosion deals 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) to the target object. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to half, cannot reduce the object below 1 hp, and prevents the explosion from injuring bystanders. If the object fails its save, the explosion caused by the object deals 1d6 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d6) to all within a 10-ft. radius (Reflex save for half). Because the magic of the spell is affecting the object and not those caught in the blast, spell resistance does not apply to those nearby.
