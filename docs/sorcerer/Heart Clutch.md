### 📜 Description
The caster extends a hand toward the target, pronouncing his doom, and then clutches his hand as if grasping and squeezing the target's heart. This spell deals 3d6 points of Constitution damage on a failed saving throw. Upon a successful save the spell deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage and the target becomes immune to the same caster's heart clutch spells for 24 hours. If the target is slain by this spell, its heart tears free from its body and leaps into the caster's outstretched hand.
