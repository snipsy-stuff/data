### 📜 Description
This spell afflicts the target with random bouts of glossolalia, a condition in which a person's speech is random and often incomprehensible. Unlike the standard symptoms of this unfortunate ailment, the victim of the spell simply has no control and often says inappropriate things, especially at inopportune times. Consult the chart below for the effects during any given round. 

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, curse of truth, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
