### 📜 Description
You create a sphere of iron, about the size of a walnut in your hand, which you can use to make a melee touch attack or throw as a splash weapon, making a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 120 feet. If the sphere is wielded by any other creature, treat it as an improvised melee weapon (-4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls) or as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. When the sphere hits (either as a ranged or melee attack), it breaks and discharges a flash of iron splinters and magical force. The flash deals 1d6 points of magical cold iron piercing damage per caster level to the target struck (creatures with damage reduction not overcome by magic, cold iron, piercing damage, reduce the damage by their listed amount per die). All creatures and objects in adjacent squares (including the target and the wielder if the wielder isn't you) take 1 point of splash damage per die. All the metal possessions and objects they carry (whether ferrous or not) become magnetized for 2d4 rounds. A creature wearing metal armor is entangled while the effect lasts, while a creature using metal weapons takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls so long as there is at least 10 lb. of metal on its person or within 5 feet of it (these penalties stack). A successful saving through negates the magnetism effect and reduces the damage by half.
