### 📜 Description
A tiny metallic cylinder under your direction rushes from your hand to its intended destination where you can detonate it at any time within the next 5 rounds. Triggering the explosion in a subsequent round only requires an immediate action. When the cylinder erupts, the intense vibrations ripple through the water stunning creatures underwater for 1 round and dealing 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level to all creatures underwater within the area of effect (maximum 15d6). Creatures not underwater but within the area of effect suffer only the damage dealt by the spell. A successful saving throw negates the stunning effect and reduces the sonic damage by half.
