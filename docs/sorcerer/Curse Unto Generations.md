### 📜 Description
You mimic any 7th or lower level curse spell (a spell with a permanent duration that cannot be dispelled but can be removed by specific spells such as remove curse) For a male victim, this curse affects him, his brothers, his sons, and his sons' male offspring for four generations; for a female, it affects her, her sisters, her daughters, and her daughters' female offspring for four generations. This spell has no effect on genderless creatures and eunuchs.

This spell cannot be dispelled but it can be negated by a remove curse, limited wish, miracle or a wish. Remove curse and limited wish grant a second saving throw for the original subject; an unsuccessful save results in the spell having no further effects. Miracle or wish must be cast in the presence of the original recipient (or his grave) to break the curse completely. An individual can only be the subject of one curse unto generations spell.
