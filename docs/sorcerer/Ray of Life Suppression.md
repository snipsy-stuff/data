### 📜 Description
A coruscating ray springs from your hand and disrupts a creature's life spark, weakening it. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The target takes Constitution damage equal to 1d6+1/two levels (maximum 1d6+5). The target loses any temporary Constitution bonuses, such as from a barbarian's rage ability or from bear's endurance, first. Treat temporary losses to Constitution as ability damage for the spell's duration.

This spell cannot drop a target's Constitution below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this spell's Constitution damage by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. If a creature is the target of multiple ray of life suppression spells, simply apply the highest such penalty that would affect it.
