### 📜 Description
You cast this spell on a conveyance or mount to make it memorize the course you follow for the next 1 hour/caster level. The journey instilled in this memory remains until either replaced by a new journey or dispelled. At any future trip through this area, the conveyance does not require guidance. 

Upon command, the subject steers itself to any point stored in its memory. If it passes beyond the bounds of its recorded journey, it immediately drifts aimlessly until correctly piloted. A conveyance or mount can only hold one journey in its memory at a time. This only cause a conveyance to guide itself, it still must have its own source of locomotion.
