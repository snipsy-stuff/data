### üìú Description
This spell summons an ooze that appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. As a move action, you can direct it to attack a particular enemy or not to attack, but you cannot command it to perform other actions. This spell creates an ooze from the 1st level list on the table below. You choose which kind of ooze to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. 

When casting any summon slime spell, you can create a 5-foot square patch of slippery slime in lieu of a 1st-level ooze, equivalent to a grease spell (though you may cast it only upon a solid surface, not on an object). As an inanimate hazard, a patch of slime cannot be commanded to move or take actions. You can add one or more of the following effects to the patch of slime you create. Each effect you add causes the slime to be treated as equivalent to a creature one level higher (see the Summon Slime Monsters table below). You cannot add the same effect more than once

Acidic slime (+1 level): Creatures moving through the slime's space take 1 point of acid damage per square they enter. A creature falling prone in the acidic slime takes an additional 1d6 points of acid damage regardless of how many squares of slime he has crossed.

Caustic slime (+2 levels): As acidic slime above. In addition, this slime also emits toxic acidic vapors that deal 1 point of Constitution damage to creatures passing through a square containing the vapors (DC 13 Fortitude negates). A creature falling prone in a square of acidic slime takes a -2 penalty to its saving throw against the vapors. This is a poison effect.

Foul slime (+2 levels): Any creature touching the slime is exposed to slimy doom. Creatures falling prone in the slime take a -2 penalty to their save against this disease. 

Green slime (+3 levels): Any creature touching the slime is exposed to green slime.

Large slime (variable): You can increase the radius of the patch(es) of slime you create by 5 feet for each level increase you apply. 

Casting the spell in this fashion is a creation effect rather than a summoning effect.
