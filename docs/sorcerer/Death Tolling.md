### üìú Description
This spell must be cast on a specially prepared metal bell. Anyone ringing the enspelled bell can then potentially deal damage to all living creatures within earshot. Each time the bell rings, all living creatures within the area of effect are struck by an audible wave of necromantic energies. The magic creates only one such wave per round; additional ringing attempts cause only normal chiming. On the first round, this sonic attack causes damage equal to one-half the death tolling caster's level in hit points, rounded down (a 17th-level wizard would inflict 8 points of damage). Every successive time the bell is rung, the amount of damage dealt by the wave is reduced by 1 point.

Once the damage reaches zero, the spell ends (the bell can ring normally, but it won't deal damage until death tolling is cast on it again). The damage occurs in a 50-foot-radius spread/caster level (so the wave produced by a 15th-level sorcerer would have a maximum range of 750 feet). Aside from the bellringer and creatures incapable of hearing (including permanently or temporarily deafened individuals), all living creatures in earshot are affected unless underwater or protected by a building, cave, or some other natural phenomenon (such as the roar of a waterfall) that prevents them from properly hearing the toll of the bell (GM's discretion). Only living creatures able to hear as humans do are affected bythis spell; constructs, oozes, plants, and undead of all types are immune.

Every creature within the area of effect may attempt a Will save to avoid damage. Any successful Will save results in half damage but also prevents a creature from suffering additional damage from that particular death tolling casting (no matter how often thereafter that creature hears the bell's sonic attack). A caster can only have one death tolling spell in effect at a time, a second casting discharges the previous spell.
