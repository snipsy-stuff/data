### 📜 Description
Predatory stealth masks the presence of the selected creatures, granting them a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks and preventing them from being automatically detected by scent. Creatures with the scent ability must make Perception checks to detect affected creatures (and any items they carry) as if they lacked that ability. Creatures with the blindsense ability are likewise unable to detect the subjects' presence, while those with blindsight can detect the subjects' presence as if using blindsense instead.
