### üìú Description
You spray forth a line of acid that corrodes everything in its path and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Unlike normal magic spells, this spell damages attended objects within its area. For each creature caught within the blast, 1d4 of its items are affected by the spell. For each creature within the line, first determine the top four items the creature has likely to have affected (from table below) then roll randomly among those four to see which is affected. Remove that item from the list, add the next most likely item, and repeat the process until all affected items have been determined.

Order*     Item 
1st            Shield 
2nd           Armor 
3rd            Magic helmet 
4th            Item in hand (including weapon, wand, etc.)
5th            Magic cloak 
6th            Stowed or sheathed weapon 
7th            Magic bracers
8th            Magic clothing
9th            Magic jewelry (including rings) 
10th          Anything else

*In order of most likely to be affected.

Each affected item makes its own saving throw. (If both the creature targeted and the object make their saving throws, damage to the object is negated. If either the creature or item made its saving throw, damage to the object is halved, but if both saves fail, the object takes full damage.) If the object's possessor has the benefit of either evasion or improved evasion, the object gains those benefits as well. If the possessor has acid resistance or immunity, the objects the creature carries also gain the benefit of that ability.
