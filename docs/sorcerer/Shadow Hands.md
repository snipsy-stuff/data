### 📜 Description
A wave of murky blackness shoots from your hands. You must hold your hands together and then pull them apart quickly, to either side of you. The sheet of blackness is nearly as thick as your hand. Any creature in the area of the blackness takes 1d4 points of cold damage per your caster level (maximum of 5d4). This spell is closely related to the burning hands spell of the surface world, but is considered more practical in a lightless environment.
