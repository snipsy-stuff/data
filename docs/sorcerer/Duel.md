### 📜 Description
Duel requires a minimum of two arcane casters-you and another willing participant-with no maximum number of participants.

This spell creates an illusionary combat terrain that only the participants of the duel can see. Anyone else sees the casters going through all the actions of casting spells and apparently being affected by spells. However, no spells are cast and the participants may appear foolish to those not involved.

The casters involved in the duel may cast any spells they know. The spells must be studied that day (for prepared casters) or known (for spontaneous casters) but are not removed from the casters' daily allotment of spells. The spells' normal casting requirements apply, including the use of material components. The spells cause illusory damage, disability, or enhancements to the caster or opponents. Participants can counterspell normally.

Anyone involved in a duel who drops to 0 hp or below by illusory damage (or if they are instantly killed by a spell effect) falls prone until an opponent helps them to their feet. When the injured caster is assisted, all illusory damage and spell effects are removed from both casters.

Any caster that participates in a duel for 1 hour receives an insight bonus of +1 to hit with spells that require an attack roll, or a +1 insight bonus to Spellcraft checks for next 12 hours This benefit must be selected at the end of the duel.

Any participant that draws a real weapon, uses a magic item that does not benefit spell casting, uses any spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary ability that causes real damage, or casts a non-arcane spell (or any non-participant that interferes with the duel) causes the duel spell to end for all participants. In that case, no participants receive a bonus.

A caster may cast duel just once per day.
