### 📜 Description
This spell produces a globe of utter blackness that explodes silently from a point you select. Creatures caught within the globe are nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds and take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6). Half this damage is cold damage and half is negative energy damage, with a successful Reflex save resulting in the creature being sickened for 1 round and reducing the damage by half. Undead creatures in the area of effect ignore cold damage from this spell and are not nauseated or sickened, even as the negative energy heals them of 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 12d6).

Blackburst dispels any light spells of lower than 9th level within its area.
