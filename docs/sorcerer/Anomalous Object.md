### 📜 Description
You touch an object and bend time to create an exact duplicate of the object for the duration of the spell. If another creature is holding the object, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against that creature to successfully create the duplicate. Any effect that affects the original object also affects the duplicate (charges spent, damage taken, etc.), and any effect that affects the duplicate also affects the original object. If either object is destroyed, both are destroyed.
