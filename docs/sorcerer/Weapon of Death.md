### 📜 Description
This spell conjures up a large ghostly weapon (reflecting the caster's focus) that crackles with black necromantic energy. The weapon of death floats at the side of the caster and follows her wherever she goes. The ghostly weapon acts as a conduit between the Negative Energy Plane and the Material Plane and can be used to deliver life-draining attacks on living creatures or to heal undead via a successful touch attack. 

As a swift action or as part of the initial casting, the caster can send the weapon of death outward up to 15 feet away from her and have it attack any target within that range. Once the hammer begins attacking a particular target it will continue to attack that target without requiring concentration or additional actions from the caster. Switching targets is a swift action. The weapon of death otherwise behaves like a spiritual weapon in terms of its movement and range. 

The weapon of death attacks once per round, and deals 3d6 points of negative energy damage, plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) upon a successful touch attack. Whenever a living creature is touched by the weapon of death it suffers 1 negative level. Undead creatures touched by the weapon suffer no damage and are instead healed of the damage that the weapon of death would have dealt. 

If the weapon of death slays the target, it consumes the remains utterly in holy (or unholy) fire (but not its equipment or possessions). 

Spells or items that ward against negative energy and/or energy drain can protect a creature against this spell's effects. However, each time the weapon of death strikes a creature that is warded against negative energy or energy drain, the caster may make an immediate caster level check to dispel the warding effect, exactly as if the weapon of death were a targeted dispel magic against the warding effect.
