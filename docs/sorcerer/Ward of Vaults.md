### 📜 Description
First used to protect the tombs of the wealthy, this spell renders a building or other structure resistant to thievery. Within the structure so warded (or part of the structure, if the area of the spell is insufficient to encompass the whole thing), the following modifications are in effect:

• Disable Device and Perception skill checks suffer a -15 circumstance penalty.

• Spells and spell-like effects of Conjuration (Teleportation), other magical transportation into or out of the building, spell effects that unlock or otherwise open portals and doors, and spells permitting movement through walls or solid objects must make a caster level check to function (DC equal to 15 + your caster level).

• All save DCs for any traps built in the structure before the spell increase by +4.

If you possess the focus of the spell you are immune to all these effects. The caster can create multiple foci at the time of casting.
