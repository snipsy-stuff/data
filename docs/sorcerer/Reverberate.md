### 📜 Description
You strike the spell focus against the ground, shaking the earth before you with the impact. Creatures and objects touching the ground in the spell's area take 1d6 hp sonic damage/2 levels (maximum 5d6 at 10th level) and fall prone. If a creature succeeds at its Reflex save, it takes half damage and does not fall prone.
