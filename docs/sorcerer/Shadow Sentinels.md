### 📜 Description
Shadow sentinels creates the illusion of faceless Medium-sized warriors (AC 20) under your command. The sentinels may be commanded to "guard," where they shouts an alarm if they notice anyone approach within 30 ft. (using the caster's Perception score); "patrol," where they follow a route first walked by the caster and calls an alarm if they notice anyone approach within 30 feet; and "attack," where they attack with their physical attacks (2d6 damage + 1 point /2 levels). The sentinels have a BAB equal to the caster's level and add the caster's associated stat bonus (a 14th level sorcerer with a Charisma of 17 creates a sentinel with a BAB of +14, and an attack of +17). They inflict 1d8+1 damage. The sentinels may provide allies a flanking bonus, but do not benefit from one. The sentinels are discharged after being successfully struck for 30 points of damage (they use the caster's saving throws).
