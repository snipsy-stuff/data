### 📜 Description
You initiate a shockwave centered at the point you designate that instantly explodes in a 30-ft. radius. The shockwave deals no direct damage, but it makes a bull rush attempt against every creature in the shockwave's radius. The shockwave's CMB equals your level + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is greater) + 4, and it makes a single check against all affected creatures. Each creature 20 to 35 ft. away from the shockwave's origin gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its CMD against the bull rush attempt, while creatures 40 or more ft. from the origin gain a +4 circumstance bonus to CMD.

Creatures bull rushed by this spell's effects must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone.
