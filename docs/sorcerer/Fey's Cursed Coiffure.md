### 📜 Description
The fey delight in showing that people are naught but animals, and this spell follows that tradition. Unless the target makes a Fortitude save, all the body's hair bursts forth, growing 1 ft. per round for three rounds-generally to the delight and amusement of onlookers. This spell affects even things not normally considered hairy, such as undead, dragons, or reptiles. Oozes and elementals are immune.

On the first round, the target loses its Charisma bonus; on the second round, it loses its Dexterity bonus. By the third round, three feet of hair hang off the target's torso, back, head, face, and each limb, allowing the target to move only at half normal speed. The effects are cumulative and last until the hair is removed.

The force of hair growth is sufficient to rip through normal clothing, but not armor, from which the hair pushes out from every opening rather uncomfortably. The hair may be removed naturally via cutting and shaving (some compare it to shearing sheep). A successful remove curse, if cast within 24 hours, causes the extra hair to immediately slough off.
