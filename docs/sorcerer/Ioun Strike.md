### 📜 Description
You conjure a small, super-dense ioun stone of a color and shape of your choosing and hurl it at your enemy. The stone requires a ranged touch attack to hit. If the stone hits its target, it flashes out of existence in a burst of bright light and deals 1d6 hp bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage (as you prefer) per level (maximum 5d6). Additionally, the target is blinded for 1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the blindness effect.

Sightless creatures are immune to his secondary effect.
