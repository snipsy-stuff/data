### 📜 Description
Your face becomes a golden death mask with gems for eyes. As a standard action, as long as this spell's duration lasts, you may direct your gaze at a creature within 30 ft. of you. A targeted creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or be turned to stone, as the flesh to stone spell, for 1 round per your level.

On a successful save, the target's joints stiffen and its limbs grow heavy. The target is staggered for 1 round/level, so it can take either a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, the target takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. It moves at half its normal speed (rounded down to the next 5-ft. increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed. This effect dispels haste..

Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell. Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack-foes and allies are not in danger of petrification simply from meeting your gaze.
