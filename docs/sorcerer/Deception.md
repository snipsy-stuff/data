### 📜 Description
You become invisible (as greater invisibility, a glamer), and at the same time, illusory doubles of you (as programed image and mirror image, figments) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your doubles move away on a programmed course. The doubles appear within range but thereafter move as you programmed them. You can make a figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figments can then move in different directions. The doubles move at your speed and can talk and gesture as if they were real, but they cannot attack or cast spells, though they can pretend to do so.
