### 📜 Description
This enchantment causes the target creature to believe one idea, no matter how ridiculous. The "fact" may not be about the target, it may not suggest a future action or event, and it must be expressed in a single sentence of 20 words or fewer. Statements such as 'these papers authorize us to be here," 'the First Hero performs unspeakable acts with kobolds," 'the Questor's Society keep everyone poor and ignorant" will work. However, 'the First Hero must die" will not.
