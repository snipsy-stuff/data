### 📜 Description
A specific creature you name (a creature without a name is immune) must immediately steal the nearest object it is aware of - something that's worth at least 500 gp and does not belong to it. Once the subject takes the object, the spell ends. The creature may have to go through threatened or dangerous areas (passing by guards or moving through an area protected by a glyph of warding) to get at the object, or it may even have to break through a barrier or pick a lock. A barrier that requires more than 10 rounds to get through is considered impassable for the purposes of this spell. The spell ends immediately if the creature physically cannot reach the object - including a situation forcing the creature to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it.

For example, a creature with only 30 hp that must swim through acid to reach the object is unaffected by the spell. While under the effects of protection from evil or a similar spell, the subject can ignore the compulsion, but such a ward does not prevent establishing call of the emecall of the emeraldrald, nor dispel it.
