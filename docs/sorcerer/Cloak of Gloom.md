### üìú Description
Depending on the version of the spell you cast, you can conceal yourself in a dim aura or create a dusky barrier. Either effect saps your foes' will to fight.

‚Ä¢ Personal Cloak: Your body and everything within 5 feet of you becomes blanketed in magical darkness which does not hinder your sight, it also grants you total concealment (attacks against you have a 50% miss chance). In addition, unless they make successful Will saves, your enemies become shaken for as long as they remain within the pitch black area and for 1 round thereafter. A foe that makes a successful Will save cannot be shaken again by this particular casting of the spell.

‚Ä¢ Barrier: You create a wall of magical darkness that obscures sight, granting total concealment (50% miss chance) if line of sight between an attacker and a target passes through at least part of the barrier's minimum 10-foot width. Enemies which enter the area of the barrier (or are inside when you create it) must make a successful Will save or become shaken for as long as they remain inside and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that makes a successful save cannot be affected again by this particular casting of the spell.

The second version of this spell provides concealment for all creatures within the area of effect (even from you), but your allies are not subject to the either version's fear effects.
