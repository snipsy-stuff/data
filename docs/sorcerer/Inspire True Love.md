### 📜 Description
With a single utterance, you can shoot a ray of force at a selected target. To hit you must make a ranged touch attack. When this spell is cast, the target becomes destined to encounter within a week's time his true love, the one person in the world with whom he would achieve his greatest happiness. It does not mean he will recognize that person when he encounters her; if the target takes special precautions to isolate himself to ensure he knows who his true love must be, something will inevitably thwart the plan.
