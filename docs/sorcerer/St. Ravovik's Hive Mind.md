### 📜 Description
You initiate a hive mind that spreads by touch. While casting this, you can touch a creature to include them in this hive mind. Any hive-mind member may touch any willing creature as a standard action to include them in it, but the hive mind can include no more than 10 willing creatures per your level.

No member of the hive mind can control or communicate with another member telepathically with this spell, but each new member does gain full access to the hive mind's pooled knowledge, which excludes personal secrets but includes sensed dangers and events. No member is flat-footed unless all members are flat-footed. Also, each member makes Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks and ability checks as if he were the individual member with the greatest chance of success.
