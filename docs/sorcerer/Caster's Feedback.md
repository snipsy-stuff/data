### 📜 Description
This spell creates a field that hampers spellcasting (including the spell's caster) for the duration of the spell. Any time a creature (including the caster) tries to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability within the area of the emanation, the spell fails as if countered and explodes in the creature's face, dealing 1d6 points of force damage per spell level of the spell, up to a maximum of 9d6 force damage. Thus a failed attempt to cast delayed blast fireball would deal a 7d6 points of force damage to the creature. This field has no effect on dispel magic, greater dispel magic or antimagic field.
