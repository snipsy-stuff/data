### 📜 Description
An invisible ray of force springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), the creature is pushed back 60 ft. (or until he strikes a barrier, suffering damage as if he had fallen 60 ft.), is knocked prone and suffers 1d4 Constitution damage. Flying creatures and swimming creatures must make the appropriate skill check (Fly or Swim, DC 11+your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier) or be forced downward to the limit of the spell's range; if they reach a horizontal surface they are knocked prone upon that surface.
