### 📜 Description
You cause a single creature who in life had sworn a Vow of Obedience to rise from the dead to serve their master beyond the grave. If their master is now dead, the corpse rises as a revenant determined to avenge its master. Any special abilities that would normally apply against the revenant’s own murderer apply instead to its master’s murderer. If the target’s master still lives (or has risen as a sentient undead), the target is instead reanimated as a skeletal champion, with its Vow of Obedience to its former master made permanent and unbreakable.
