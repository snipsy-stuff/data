### 📜 Description
The target of this curse has one named class ability or named universal monster ability (see Pathfinder Bestiary), that is spoken at the time of casting, per 4 caster levels you possess, rendered non-functional (a rogue cannot sneak attack, a dragon cannot use its breath weapon etc.).

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. A remove curse grants a second saving throw but if this save is unsuccessful the spell has no further effect.
