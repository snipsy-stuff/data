### üìú Description
This spell creates a blast of air and grit at storm strength (approximately 70 mph) that originates from you and affects all creatures in its area. The force of the blast deals 1d8 points per two caster levels (maximum 15d8). Creatures caught in the blast are allowed Reflex saves for half damage. Creatures in the blast may be knocked down or pushed back if they fail their saves. Small or smaller creatures are blown away and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet if standing on the ground (taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet), or are battered back 2d6 x 10 feet (taking 2d6 points of nonlethal damage) if flying. Medium creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x10 feet. Large or Huge creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6 x 5 feet. Gargantuan or Colossal creatures can move normally within a teeth of the wind effect. In any event, though, teeth of the wind can't move a creature beyond the limit of the spell's range. 

Regardless of size, all creatures take a -8 penalty on Listen checks and ranged attack rolls for thrown weapons in the spell's area. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible, and siege engines have a -4 penalty on attack rolls. The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly, with a 75% chance to be extinguished as well. In addition to the effects noted, teeth of the wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do, including fan a large fire, move unsecured objects (treat them as creatures of the appropriate size), heel over a ship, or blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.
