### 📜 Description
This spell summons forth a shrieking maelstrom of negative energy that completely fills the target area. Any living creature caught in the initial burst suffers 15d6 points of negative energy damage, though a successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half. 

For each creature in the area of effect that is killed by the engulfing doom, the radius of the emanation increases by 5 feet at the beginning of the following round and the damage caused increases by 1d6. If, for example, 3 targets are killed by the spell, at the beginning of the next round the radius increases by 15 feet, and the damage caused increases by 3d6 to cause a total of 19d6 hit points of damage to all creatures caught in the area of effect. The maximum damage this spell can cause in a given round is 25d6 hit points, but there is no maximum to the area of effect. If the spell fails to kill a creature the spell discharges. Undead creatures in the area are healed for half this amount of damage.
