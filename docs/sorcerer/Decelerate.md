### 📜 Description
You slow the flow of time around a creature. The target's speed is halved each round at the beginning of his or her turn, rounded up to the nearest 5-ft. increment. This reduction to speed is treated as a penalty.

For example, a character with a speed of 30 ft. begins the next turn with a speed of 15 ft., the following round with a speed of 10 ft., and the following and subsequent rounds with a speed of 5 ft. This spell cannot reduce a creature's speed to less than 5 ft. The target may spend a full-round action each round to attempt another saving throw. If the target successfully saves on the initial or subsequent saving throws, the reduction to speed lasts for the following round and then ends.
