### 📜 Description
This insidious spell creates an illusory image chosen by the caster, usually the caster, someone close to the target, or someone whom the target trusts. This image is overlaid on his sense of reality and is accepted as real by all his senses (including touch); even magical effects such as true seeing fail to dismiss the image, though it will reveal it to be false. If the victim does not know the image to be false, statements or arguments by others that contradict the phantasm become altered or twisted to conform to the victim's perceptions. The illusory image does everything in its power to mislead the victim into eventually committing a tragic act (e.g., killing himself or a loved one, or committing an act of extreme heinousness that is against the subject creature's nature). The illusion ends when the tragic act has been committed, leaving the spell's target to deal with the consequences. The phantasm also records everything the subject experiences including the subject's very thoughts, while under the effect of this spell. If the caster dismisses the spell, all of that information is conveyed to the caster. 

The treacherous phantasm is a particularly subtle illusion, usually taking weeks or months to work its magic. A dispel magic has no effect, though a break enchantment may dispel the illusion.
