### 📜 Description
A specific creature you name (a creature without a name is immune) must dedicate all of its actions to killing or destroying a specific creature you name (a creature without a name cannot be the target of the assassination). After the subject kills or destroys the assassination target, the spell ends. You can force the target to act immediately or allow it to prepare, though its every action is forced toward working towards the eventual assassination. If you give the creature time you can later force it to act immediately.

The subject may have to pass through dangerous areas (moving through a region covered by enemy archers) to get at the creature, or it may even have to break through a barrier. The spell ends immediately if the subject physically cannot reach the creature - including a situation forcing the subject to pass through an area that would, without a doubt, kill it.

For example, a subject that breathes only in water but must cross land to reach its target is unaffected by the spell. While under the effects of mind blank, protection from evil or a similar spell, the subject can ignore the compulsion, but such a ward does not prevent establishing call of the obsidian, nor dispel it.
