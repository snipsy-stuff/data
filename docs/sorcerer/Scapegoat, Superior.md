### 📜 Description
This spell transfers your bad luck to another creature. You nominate creatures within range each time you transfer a roll to be the scapegoat, or recipient. While the spell is in effect, if you fail an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, you may transfer that failed roll to a chosen scapegoat that has failed its save and roll again. You cannot transfer more than four rolls, must accept the results of your second roll and cannot transfer more than one roll each round. Once you have successfully transferred the four rolls, the spell discharges. If a target has yet to take an action that would use the transferred rolls (for instance, if the scapegoat chooses to move instead of attacking), you cannot transfer another poor roll to him and much choose another target to be your new scapegoat.
