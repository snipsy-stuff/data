### üìú Description
You, or a messenger touched by you, sends a phantasmal message and a trap to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to the person's identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is two-way. The recipient can ask questions or offer information, though the messenger cannot gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. In addition the subject is trapped in a permanent dream of a perfect idyllic world from which he cannot awake. A successful save prevents the trap, though it still results in the message being delivered. A successful save against this spell makes the target immune to further castings of this spell from the same caster.

Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger can enter the trance at any time during its duration and visit with the recipient. 

Creatures that don't sleep (such as elves, but not halfelves) or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell. 

The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw) while in the trance. 

This spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse, break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Remove curse only grants a second saving throw, if unsuccessful, subsequent castings have no effect. Removal of the spell in this manner results in the subject suffering a -4 morale penalty to all d20 rolls for 24 hours.
