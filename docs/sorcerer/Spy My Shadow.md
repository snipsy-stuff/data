### 📜 Description
You whisper a fey rhyme to your shadow, bringing it to life as a tenebrous spy that can slip under doors, between shutters, and through the narrowest of cracks. You may stretch your shadow up to 10x your height and move it as you wish, although it remains two dimensional and cannot interact with physical objects.

You may spy through your shadow's eyes and ears as if they were your own, but magically enhanced senses do not work through this spell. Your shadow uses your Stealth skill normally to remain hidden. It gains a +4 bonus to Stealth checks in dim lighting but suffers a -4 penalty in brightly lit areas.

Enemies who see your shadow can make attacks against it using your touch AC, although the shadow is incorporeal. Damage or effects inflicted upon your shadow affect you as though the attack had hit you.
