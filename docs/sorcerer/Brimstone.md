### 📜 Description
A fiery, smoking stone the size of a walnut appears in your palm. The stone is hot enough to ignite flammable materials and deals 1d4 points of fire damage each round that it stays in contact with a creature or object, but won't hurt you or your equipment as long as you keep it in hand. You can use the stone to make a melee touch attack or you can throw it as a splash weapon, making a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 120 feet. If the stone is wielded by any other creature, treat it as an improvised melee weapon (-4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls) or as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Note, though, that any other creature wielding it takes damage each round in which the stone is held.

When the stone hits (either as a ranged or melee attack), it breaks and releases a flash of heat and acrid smoke. The flash deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4, no save) to the target struck, while all creatures in adjacent squares (including the target and the wielder if the wielder isn't you) must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) disperses the smoke and negates its effects.
