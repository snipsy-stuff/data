### 📜 Description
This spell functions as harrying cipher, but with the following statistics:

A marauding cipher attacks by delivering a jolt of force energy in melee combat. A marauding cipher may also blend in with its surroundings and camouflage itself by remaining motionless against a surface for 1 round without moving, after which it gains a +10 circumstance bonus to its Stealth check. This bonus is lost if the cipher moves onto different looking terrain, requiring another full round to camouflage itself upon the new terrain

A marauding cipher can follow up to three simple commands at once and can report all that it has seen and heard to the caster (using rudimentary words and phrases).

Casting summon monster in conjunction with a marauding cipher produces a construct that resembles and acts in all ways as the summoned creature, gaining the ink subtype (see the inkblot spell. Combining this cipher with illusory script makes a marauding cipher construct invisible.

This spell requires material components that consist of ink mixed with your own fresh blood, which you must obtain by dealing 6 hp damage to yourself. This damage cannot be healed as long as the cipher exists.
