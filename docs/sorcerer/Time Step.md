### 📜 Description
Your movements become as darting as a hummingbird's, as if the rest of the world briefly pauses while you move and act.

For all natural modes of movement (including land, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) your base movement distance is doubled, including 5-ft. steps (which in essence become 10-ft. steps). You can, for instance, cast a spell or take some other standard action and then make what would normally be a double move.

This will stack with another spell or similar effect that grants an enhancement bonus to your base speed (such as expeditious retreat) but it will not stack with a magically conferred movement type with a set speed (such as fly or burrow) or an enhancement with a specified maximum (such as haste). As with expeditious retreat, this spell will affect your jumping distance.
