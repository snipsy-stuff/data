### 📜 Description
You exhale a breath of oblivion. Each creature and object in the area is subject to a disintegrate spell that deals 2d6 hp of damage/2 caster levels (maximum 20d6). Like disintegrate, a successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to 5d6 hp.

When an object is in the cone's path, breath of Veles simply disintegrates as much as a 30-ft. cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as forceful hand or a wall of force, but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic field.
