### 📜 Description
Smoldering magic stones pound down for 1 round, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 3d6 points of fire damage to creatures and objects in the area of effect. Within the brimstone storm, add +4 to the DC of all Perception checks, and all land movement is at one-half speed. While the stones fall, and for 1 round per caster level thereafter, acrid smoke fills the area, obscuring all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance), while creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 1 round. A living creature entering the smoke or caught within it must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains inside and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that makes a successful save but remains within the smoke must make another Fortitude save each round, with the DC increasing by 1 point per round the creature has spent within the smoke.
