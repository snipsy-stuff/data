### 📜 Description
This spell covers an area of the floor or ground with a carpet of fire. The caster has a good degree of control over the area at the time of casting and can create nearly any pattern; the only conditions are that the covered area has to be in a series of five foot by five foot squares and that the whole area must be contiguous. The fire deals 3d6 points of damage +1 point per level each round to any creature within it. Any creature that is within the area the round that the carpet is created is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. This spell also sets fire to any combustible materials upon a failed save.
