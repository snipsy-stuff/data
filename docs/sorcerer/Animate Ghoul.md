### 📜 Description
This spell causes one humanoid corpse to rise as a ghoul under your control. As long as the corpse is a Medium humanoid, it rises as a standard ghoul, regardless of any class levels, HD, or abilities it had in life. This spell can also be used on a Small humanoid to create a Small ghoul. If the caster is 11th level or higher, it can be used on the corpse of a Large humanoid to create a Large ghoul. If the caster is at least 13th level, this spell can be used to create a ghast instead, but the material component changes to an onyx gemstone worth at least 200 gp.

Undead created by this spell are loyal to the caster, but are subject to the usual Hit Dice limit for the number of undead that can be controlled (as per animate dead).
