### 📜 Description
The target of the spell sprouts bony spikes all over its body, head, and limbs for the duration of the spell. This does not harm the target, but it does give it a natural piercing attack similar to armor spikes, except it is always proficient with them. Otherwise, use the rules and damage for armor spikes found in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook.
