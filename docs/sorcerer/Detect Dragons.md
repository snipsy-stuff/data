### 📜 Description
You can detect the presence of draconic creatures, even if they are disguised, or under the effects of glamer or polymorph spells. The information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

1st Round: You detect the presence or absence of creatures with the dragon type.

2nd Round: You detect the number of such creatures in the area of effect and the condition of the healthiest or most powerful one (HD or CR).

3rd Round: You learn the power (HD or CR) of each such creature and its location. If the creatures are in your line of sight, you can make one Knowledge (arcana or dungeoneering) check per creature to determine their ages, types (as in metallic or chromatic), and colors. The true form of a disguised draconic creature appears to you as a faint outline.
