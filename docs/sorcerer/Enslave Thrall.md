### 📜 Description
You project your dark nature into the distant Hells, allowing you to call a more powerful, evil familiar.

Casting this spell directly before a ritual to replace your familiar allows you to choose a familiar with the demon, devil, or daemon subtype from the Improved Familiar list without taking the feat. You must meet the alignment and level requirements as listed for the familiar you choose.

Once you have completed the familiar ritual, the creature is no longer considered called, and it takes on all the regular properties of familiars with two exceptions. Its type does not change, and it does not gain the ability to speak with other creatures of its kind, even if it has the ability to communicate.
