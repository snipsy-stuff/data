### 📜 Description
You conjure water in the form of a Nereid that seems to kiss the target and force itself into the target's lungs. Onlookers see the brief watery form of the Nereid as it appears to dive inside the victim. Since the target's lungs fill rapidly with water holding, its breath does no good. The character must make a DC 10 Constitution to avoid drowning. Each round, the DC increases by 1. When the subject finally fails its Constitution check, it begins to drown. In the first round, it falls unconscious (0 hp). In the following round, it drops to -1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, it drowns. Creatures that can breathe water or do not breathe are immune to this spell.
