### 📜 Description
You grasp the space between a moving object and its destination and stretch it in a tall arc through an alternate dimension, allowing you to pause surrounding events at will. To all observers, when you trigger this spell's effect, the moving object appears to stop abruptly and pause for 1 round. It then resumes its original velocity. During the paused round, you (or anyone else) might sidestep a killing arrow, kick in a door before letting paused bullets fly, or pull a head free just before a guillotine's blade slams down.
