### 📜 Description
You briefly use the power in your blood to quell the reservoir from which the target can draw its abilities.

Any spellcaster or creature with spell-like abilities targeted by quell the tide must make a Fortitude save or feel the magical power stripped from its blood. While affected by quell the tide, creatures cannot cast any spells, and a creature with spell-like abilities cannot access them. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities, however, are not affected. Creatures that fail their save are also sickened.

Any creature affected by this spell may make a Fortitude save each round to negate the spell's effects.

Additionally, quell the tide can be used to deny a sorcerer access to his bloodline powers and a wizard access to his arcane school powers, causing them to fail (or be unavailable) while the spell is in effect.
