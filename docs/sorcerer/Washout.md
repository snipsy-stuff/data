### 📜 Description
Washout creates a massive wave (even on dry land) that sweeps through the area washing away everything in its path. The wave deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per level (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within the area. Large and Huge creatures are knocked prone by the wave, while Medium or smaller creatures are carried to the end of the wave's path (usually the maximum range of the spell from you) and are knocked prone. A successful Reflex save reduces the nonlethal damage by half, and a successful Fortitude save negates the knock down effect. 

The water from the spell can also extinguish fires. Mundane fires within the area of the spell are automatically extinguished. Magic fires can also be extinguished, but to do so requires a successful caster level check (DC 11 + caster level of magical fire) against each spell to extinguish it. Elemental (fire) creatures or other creatures that are vulnerable to water take regular damage instead of nonlethal damage.
