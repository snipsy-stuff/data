### 📜 Description
Holding the viper causes one weapon to turn into a venomous snake. This snake has all the stats of a Medium viper (see Pathfinder Bestiary). This snake follows your commands to the best of its ability. It always acts on your turn, and can attack beginning on the round the spell is cast. 

If the viper is killed, it returns to its original form.
