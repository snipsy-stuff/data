### 📜 Description
You distort your subject's spatial perceptions and cloak his allies and opponents in illusions so that when he makes an attack against what he perceives to be a foe he is actually attacking his friend. Only the spell's subject can see these illusions. You see only an ephemeral outline of what a creature appears like to the subject. The target gets a Will save to recognize the illusion as unreal. 

All the target's allies appear as enemies and vice versa; the effects are determined by the GM and are appropriate (i.e. an enemy ogre will not appear as an allied halfling unless all ones enemies are ogres and all ones allies are halflings, etc.). If circumstances force particularly unlikely results, a circumstance bonus to the target's Will save may be appropriate.
