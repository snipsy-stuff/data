### 📜 Description
A leathery sphere about the size of a grapefruit appears in your palm, and can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 120 feet. If the sphere is wielded by any other creature, treat it as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. When the sphere hits, it breaks with an audible pop and releases a cloud of splinters, acidic vapor, and toxic dust. The target struck takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8), with no save (half piercing damage, half acid damage). In addition to damage, the burst fills a 15-foot radius with a toxic cloud poisoning all creatures within it (including the target and the wielder if the wielder isn't you). Toxic dust - contact; save DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Constitution damage and blindness; cure 2 consecutive saves.
