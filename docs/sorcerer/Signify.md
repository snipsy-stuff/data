### 📜 Description
This powerful spell offers an incredibly wide range of uses. It allows the caster to ask a question and derive a magical answer; the question can have any kind of phrasing and offers a complete, perfectly accurate answer (though it can be cryptic). Instead of this ability, signify can be used to duplicate the effects of any divination spell of 8th level or below, foregoing any need for material components other than those required by this spell.
