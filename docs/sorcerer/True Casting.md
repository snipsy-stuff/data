### 📜 Description
You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future that assists with your spell casting against a singular opponent. Your next spell that targets a single creature (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +1 insight bonus to the save DC. If that creature successfully saves, your next spell that targets that same creature and only that creature (if it is made before the end of the following round) gains a +2 insight bonus to the save DC. This process continues until your insight bonus reaches its maximum of +5, you fail to cast a spell targeting the same singular creature in each following round, or the target creature fails a saving throw.
