### 📜 Description
This spell summons one random wondrous item from the Minor Wondrous Item table (see above). The item appears at your feet or in your hands (your choice). These items are often in an alien style or have a garish appearance and are clearly a conjuration to anyone with a single rank in Spellcraft.

You may only have one item summoned by this spell at a time, as you must dismiss your current item or let its duration end before summoning a new wondrous item. The summoned item and its effects disappear at the end of this spell.

Addition from Summon Wondrous Item: Choose from the Medium table.

Addition from Summon Wondrous Item: Choose from the Major table.
