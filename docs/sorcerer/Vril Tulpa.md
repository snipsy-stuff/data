### üìú Description
This spell creates a tulpa, or thoughtform, made of pure vril energy harvested from a sacrificed spell. When you cast this spell, select any other prepared spell or available spell slot of 1st-level or higher. You shape the harvested vril energy of that slot into an adjacent thoughtform, creating a silvery, quasi-real version of yourself. The tulpa is tethered to your body via a fine, mercurial umbilical cord.

The thoughtform looks like you but has a silvery translucence, and it can be used just like an unseen servant, with an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 lbs., drag 100 lbs., exert 20 lbs. of force, and use skills that can be used untrained with a DC no higher than 10). The tulpa has a base land speed equal to your own, and for each level of the sacrificed spell, the tulpa has 4 hp, a duration of 2 rounds, and an AC equal to 10 + the sacrificed spell's level.

As a move action, you can direct the thoughtform to move (it cannot fly, climb, or even swim, though it can walk on water). The umbilical tether has a length of 10 ft. per spell level sacrificed to create it, and if the tulpa is directed to move beyond this range, the tether snaps and the tulpa is immediately dismissed. During your turn, you can switch from using your senses to those of the tulpa, or back again, as a swift action, and when doing so you can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is. While you are using its senses, yourbody is considered helpless.

The tulpa is primarily a remote viewing thoughtform, easily directed around corners and into rooms within range of its umbilical tether. For non-vril specialists, the tulpa cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It can be attacked and targeted (it gets no saves against attacks and cannot fight defensively), and it dissipates immediately if it takes damage equal to or greater than its hp. If the tulpa is destroyed while you are sharing its senses, your senses are shunted back to your body and you are staggered for 1 round.

Those proficient in manipulating vril (those capable of producing vril blasts, either through an archetype, bloodline, feat, spell, or wizard school) can sacrifice spells and channel vril blasts through the umbilical tether when sharing the tulpa's senses, with the blasts originating from the thoughtform instead of from the caster. You must still roll an attack roll as normal.
