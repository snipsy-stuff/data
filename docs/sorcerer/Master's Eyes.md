### 📜 Description
When you identify targets for a ranged spell, you may use your familiar's senses to identify targets within the spell's range, even if you do not have line of sight to them. Your familiar must see the creature or object to target it. You gain the following information: the existence of targets your familiar identifies, their physical position relative to you, and whether your familiar considers them allies, neutral, or enemies.

To identify a target, the familiar must make a Perception check with all normal modifiers applying. If the familiar does not sense the target and its location, it cannot identify the target or supply information on the target's location. Even if identified, the familiar's lack of line of sight may prevent a spell from targeting an individual.

Master's eyes doesn't affect the ranged spell in any way other than to provide potential targets for the spell. All other requirements for your ranged spell must be met as normal, and it still originates from you.
