### 📜 Description
You beseech a deity or other higher power to send a creature after a person who has wronged you to do battle. A deity or other high power of the DM's choosing hears your wish for vengeance and orders a creature (of the DM's choosing) to fulfill your request. The creature arrives 5 - 500 (1d100 x 5) miles away. The specific creature summoned varies, but is usually 1 CR or more higher than the caster at the time of casting. Devils, Demons, Dragons, and Magical Beasts, are the most common creatures used to fulfill the implacable beast.

The creature summoned to kill your chosen foe has quadruple standard treasure and maximum hit points (and uses whatever gear he has to the best of his ability to kill your target). If the creature has the means to, he first studies your foe using divination magic in order to more successfully engage your opponent. If he has friends or guards, the creature finds others to help deal with them so it can do battle with your opponent one on one. If the creature kills your opponent it then burns the body as an offering to the power you invoke and takes all of your opponent's belongings as a reward.

The creature summoned can take as long as one month to choose the best opportunity to attack your foe.
