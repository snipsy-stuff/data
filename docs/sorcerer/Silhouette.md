### 📜 Description
You make a shadow play against a screen or wall. The screen or wall can encompass up to 100 sq. ft. The number of creatures that can see the shadow play is equal to your Intelligence score.

The shadow figures do not make any sound, but they can dance, run, move, cast spells, kiss, fight, and so forth. Most of the figures are general types such as a rabbit or a dwarf, but a number of forms equal to your Intelligence modifier can be recognized as specific individuals.
