### üìú Description
When casting this spell, you write a short message of up to 50 words which you then conceal within a larger text (created by the spell) that seems perfectly normal and innocuous. If you use a normal writing surface, such as parchment or paper, you can use this spell without making any additional checks. If you carve the words into a surface or embellish the writing in some way, you must make the appropriate Craft check and supply all the necessary materials. For example, if you were to scribe a secret missive into the pedestal of a statue, you would need to make a Craft (stoneworking) check. Craft checks made in conjunction with this spell are normally DC 15. 

If you have them available to you, you can include explosive runes, illusory script, or sepia snake sigil in the larger text, cast as part of the secret missive's casting time.

Your hidden message looks just like part of the larger text, but the person or persons you designate at the time you cast the spell are the only ones who can readily discern it. 

A comprehend languages spell merely allows someone to read the larger text, while a true seeing spell reveals a faint web of magical tracery through the text but not the hidden message itself. The whole message has a dim aura of transmutation magic. 

A character can pick out your hidden message with a Linguistics check (DC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier at the time you cast the spell). The creature deciphering your message gains a +10 competence bonus if using true seeing while deciphering. 

When you designate who can read the text, you can specify creatures by name or can specify conditions or triggers under which the hidden message can be read. Conditions can be as general or as detailed as desired, though note that only visual and audible actions will work as conditions (such that the spell cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb), and such conditions can often be fooled by disguises and illusions. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or word, but silent movement or magical silence defeats them. When you designate who can read your hidden text, you can also limit the number of times the message can be read in total. After this number of readings, the hidden message and the text that disguises it disappear, ending the spell. You can also make the message vanish (ending the spell) under certain conditions you set, using the same guidelines for specifying who can read the message. 

A secret missive spell is destroyed when the surface that holds it is destroyed, or if the spell is dispelled or disjoined. An erase spell also removes it.
