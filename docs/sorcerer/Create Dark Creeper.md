### 📜 Description
With this spell, you bring a single dark creeper or more to life from a creature's corpse, as long as the creature has been dead for a week or less. After wrapping the corpse in the treated rags and performing a macabre ritual (which requires concentration for 30 consecutive minutes), the creature melts and reforms into a number of dark creepers depending on the creature's size.

A Small creature transforms into one dark creeper, a Medium creature becomes two dark creepers, and each size increase adds an additional dark creeper, to a maximum of six. The newly created dark creepers are typical representatives of the race, and they carry no afflictions, illnesses, or memories from the former creature. When created, the dark creepers attack your opponents to the best of their ability. If you can communicate with them, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

The corpse receives a Will save with the same modifier the creature had in life to resist this magic. As time passes, though, the former inhabitant of the corpse loses its connection to the body. For every day that passes from the creature's death, the Will save DC increases by 1. Once the spell has been successfully cast, the only way to restore the original creature to its former state is through a miracle or wish, regardless of whether the dark stalkers created from the corpse still lives.
