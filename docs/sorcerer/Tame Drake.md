### 📜 Description
This spell convinces a lesser dragon to regard you as a friend and ally (treat the dragon's attitude as friendly). A dragon you or your allies have attacked or threatened receives a +5 bonus to its Will save, while a creature that is at most one step removed from your alignment receives a -5 penalty to its save. Otherwise, this spell functions as charm person.
