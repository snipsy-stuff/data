### 📜 Description
The air around you takes on the characteristics of a light, viscous fluid. When in motion, you create a pressure wave, which may move creatures and objects around you.

Using this pressure wave, the caster gains the ability to make an Improved Bull Rush (as the feat) once per round as a free action. The CMB of the pressure wave is calculated using the caster's level + spell level + Intelligence (wizards, witches), Charisma (sorcerers) or Wisdom (druids and shamans).

This effect is active only while the caster is in motion. The pressure wave only affects creatures directly in the caster's path at any point during his movement. During movement, the pressure wave separates the caster and the target by one square. They remain separate by one square when movement stops.

Alternatively, the caster may use the liquefy air each round to move light, loose, unattached objects (e.g. papers), to move one square of a swarm, or to extinguish one square of flame.

While the air in the caster's square feels like fluid, it is otherwise unchanged and breathable.
