### 📜 Description
With this spell, you create a permanent zone of dead magic, an area where no magic can be cast, just as if the area had been affected by an antimagic field. Divination spells cannot detect subjects within dead-magic areas, nor can a spellcaster use teleport or another spell to move into or out of the zone. The only exception to the "no magic" rule is permanent planar portals, which still function normally. Zones created by this spell can be repaired, but only by a heightened limited wish (8th level or higher), miraclemiracle, or wish spell.
