### 📜 Description
The target's lungs are filled with a contact poison. This poison deals 1d3 Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures must make a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage. In addition, the subject begins to drown. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hp). In the following round, she drops to -1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, she drowns. The initial saving throw negates the drowning as only a small amount of contact poison enters the lungs.
