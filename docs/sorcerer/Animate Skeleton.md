### 📜 Description
This spell turns the body or bones of a person or creature into a skeleton. This spell will only animate dead creatures of Medium size or smaller. The skeleton can follow the caster and obey the caster's commands or can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place. The skeleton remains animated until it is destroyed. A destroyed skeleton cannot be reanimated again.

Regardless of the number of times this spell is cast, only a single skeleton from this spell may be controlled at any one time by a single caster. If another skeleton is animated using this spell while another is already under your control, the original becomes uncontrolled.

This undead does not count against your HD limit of controlled undead. An undead skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton or corpse. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.
