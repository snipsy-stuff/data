### 📜 Description
With this spell you are able to start a fire with easily combustible materials, such as paper, dried kindling, or lantern oil. As a general rule, if it could be ignited with flint and steel, it can be ignited with this spell. This spell functions much faster than the normal means of starting a fire, instantly lighting a small fire roughly equivalent to the size of a torch. This spell is not powerful to deal damage directly (though fires started by it could).
