### 📜 Description
You inscribe a sigil of any one arcane spell you know (up to 6th level) on any portable surface. Anyone or anything with such an aegis is protected;  if the selected spell or spell effect is cast on the recipient of the aegis, that spell is instantly countered (as per a ring of counterspells).

The spell requires infusing diamond dust into the ink while inscribing the sigil, costing 100 gp per level of the spell countered. Only spells up to 6th level may be countered. After the spell is countered, the aegis is destroyed. The aegis may be physically destroyed, and the effect persists only as long as the possessor retains the aegis and the aegis remains undamaged.

A character may be protected by one aegis at a time. If a second is carried by a character or inscribed on the same object, the first expires.
