### üìú Description
After casting this spell, corrosive slime oozes from one of your hands, causing no harm to you or your equipment but dealing 2d6 points of acid damage to any object or creature you strike with a successful melee touch attack, plus an additional 2d6 points of acid damage each round for the next 1d4 rounds. If you use your corrosive touch against objects your foe carries or wears, treat the touch as a sunder attempt that does not provoke an attack of opportunity and deals the same damage as above. Washing off or neutralizing the slime can negate continuing damage from this spell, but requires a full-round action and a successful Reflex save. Success is automatic if the creature or item is completely immersed in water or doused with something to neutralize the acid (such as powdered chalk or bicarbonate of soda). Wiping or scraping off the slime grants a +4 bonus to the save, but the item used to remove the slime takes 2d6 points of acid damage.
