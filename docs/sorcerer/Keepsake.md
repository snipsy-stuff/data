### 📜 Description
You bind a particular item to you. The item affected by this spell cannot be lost, and cannot be separated from you by more than ten feet; if you move farther than ten feet from the item, it will reappear within 10 feet of you within 24 hours. The item can become broken but cannot be ruined. If it would be ruined or destroyed it simply appears 24 hours later with half its hit points and the broken condition. This spell can only affect one item per person at a time.
