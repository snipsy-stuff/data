### 📜 Description
A jagged shard of bone bursts from your hand. You may fire one bone shard, plus one additional shard for every four levels beyond 2nd (to a maximum of three bone shards at 10th level). Each bone shard requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 hp piercing damage. You must be within 30 ft. of the target to make a ranged touch attack.

This damage also causes deep gashes that continue to bleed, dealing an additional 1d4 hp damage to the target each round at the start of the target's turn. This bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or through the application of any magical healing. Creatures that are not living do not sustain this bleeding damage.

The bone shards may be fired at the same or different targets, but all shards must be aimed at targets within 30 ft. of each other and fired simultaneously. The bone shards vanish immediately after hitting or missing their target.
