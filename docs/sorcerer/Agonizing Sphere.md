### 📜 Description
A palm-sized translucent sphere with a black core shoots forward. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. If it hits, the sphere inflicts 2d6 hp electrical damage + 1d6 for every two caster levels beyond third.

A creature struck by the sphere is also stunned for 1 round plus an additional round per three caster levels as electricity courses through it. On a critical hit, the target is initially stunned for 2 rounds plus the additional round per three caster levels.

A successful Fortitude save negates the stunned condition, but it does not reduce the damage.
