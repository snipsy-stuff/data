### üìú Description
The spell brings into existence a large orb of crackling electricity, which attacks nearby enemies beginning the round that it appears. The living lightning attacks indiscriminately and cannot be controlled by the caster but never attacks him or his allies. The orb attacks whatever enemy creature is closest to it at the time. If two or more enemy creatures are of equal distance away, the orb attacks the one with the greatest quantity of visible metal. 

The orb attacks by shooting small bolts of lightning at a single creature. In order to hit, it must make a ranged touch attack. The living lightning's attack bonus is equal to your caster level plus your primary casting ability modifier. If the target is wearing metal armor, is made of metal, or otherwise possessing large quantities of metal, the living lightning gains an additional +3 bonus to hit. The orb's attack has a range increment of 10 ft. and can fire up to five range increments. A successful hit by the orb deals 5d6 points of electricity damage (no save). Living lightning threatens a critical on a natural 20 and causes double damage on a successful critical hit. 

Creatures with spell resistance can resist the attacks of the living lightning, but this does not dispel the living lighting itself. Living lightning can move at a rate of 50 ft. and can fly with perfect maneuverability with a Fly skill bonus equal to its attack bonus. It will only move if there is no target in range and will then always move towards the closest enemy creature. 

The orb has no hit points and is immune to all forms of damage, but can be dispelled as any normal spell, or by any effects that might repress electricity.
