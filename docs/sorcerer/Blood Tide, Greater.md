### 📜 Description
This spell functions similar to blood tide but lasts longer and has a more dramatic effect. A creature that fails its save against greater blood tide suffers a -4 penalty to all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-base checks. It also takes 3 bleed. A creature already suffering from blood tide takes a -2 penalty to its save against this spell.

A cure moderate wounds or DC 20 Heal check can stop the bleeding created by this spell.
