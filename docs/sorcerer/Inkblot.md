### 📜 Description
You turn the subject into a malleable being of pure ink, which takes on the ink subtype. An ink creature's gear, weapons, and armor turn to ink and are absorbed into the creature; however, its size, Dexterity, deflection, and armor bonuses still apply.

Ink creatures may not manipulate objects with fine detail, though they may cling to them and move them along their wave of ink if the subject could have carried the object in its regular form. Ink creatures gain a +8 racial modifier to Stealth checks

Finally, ink creatures that assume the form of puddles act as a grease spell exactly as if cast by a caster of the same level (or hit dice) to all beings that enter it.

This spell requires a vial of indigo ink, which must be consumed during casting.
