### üìú Description
You summon an undead creature to interrogate. Unlike speak with dead, you do not need to be in the vicinity of a corpse, but you must have an item which once belonged to the target. If the target has been subjected to true necromancy within the past week, the new spell fails. Unwilling creatures get a Will save to resist the summons. If the saving throw is failed, the target creature is summoned to the caster's presence and must answer one question per two caster levels. Also unlike speak with dead, replies can be long-winded and complex if the questions call for it, such as the teaching of a spell or the recounting of a long tale. As always, the GM has the final word regarding what is possible to achieve using this spell. Casting this spell is a dangerous undertaking. Each question asked after the first grants the target a new saving throw. A successful saving throw allows the target to break free of the spell, after which it can choose to either attack the caster or return from whence it came. If the caster or his allies attack the summoned creature, the spell is automatically broken and the target is free to act as described above. If the target is killed, it disappears but is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform, during which time it can't be summoned again. Even if the target's initial saving throw is successful, the target may choose to answer the summoning and attack the caster. For this reason, this spell is often cast in conjunction with an inwardly focused magic circle against evil spell. When the spell's duration expires, the target is returned to its original location.
