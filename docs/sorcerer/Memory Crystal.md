### üìú Description
You store personal memories into a small crystal or gem. The memory must be one that you experienced or saw firsthand (which means you store the memory of hearing a tale told to you that you didn't experience, but not of the tale itself). The stored memory can last no longer than ten minutes, but can hold only one memory. 

You can recall the memory at any time. The recalled memory takes the form of a mental picture of the memory viewed in front of you as though literally through your eyes. As a result of this, others near you can also possibly see the memory. 

In order to recall a memory from a memory crystal that was not created by the person attempting the recall, the character must make a Spellcraft check (DC = 10 + the creator's caster level). 

The caster of the memory crystal can dispel the memory from the gem at will, making it a normal crystal or gem again (this is a free action). You can put a new memory into the crystal or gem at that time by casting this spell again (this erases the former memory). Others must use a dispel magic spell targeted on the memory crystal in order to destroy the memories stored within.
