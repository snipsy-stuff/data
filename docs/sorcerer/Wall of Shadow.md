### 📜 Description
A vertical curtain of shadow appears. It is 2 feet thick and considerably opaque. It blocks line of sight, and creatures within 5' of the other side of the wall have concealment (20 %) while creatures beyond 5' have total concealment (50%). Passing through the wall results in shadow stuff clinging to the creature or object, and inflicts the entangled condition (spell resistance applies). Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell.
