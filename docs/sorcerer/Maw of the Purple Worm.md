### 📜 Description
You gain a melee bite attack with a reach of 15 ft. that you can use once per round. Your attack roll is equal to your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier. You deal 4d8+ your relevant caster ability modifier and critical on a 19-20 plus you possess the grab special quality as if you were a gargantuan creature. Your CMB for the purposes of this spell is the same as your attack roll. If you successfully grab the opponent, you can swallow whole as the special quality (4d8+1 1/2 times your relevant caster ability modifier as bludgeoning damage, AC 21, 20 hp) as if you were a gargantuan creature. This is actually an extradimensional space and the damage dealt does not harm you; when the spell ends all swallowed creatures are dispelled.
