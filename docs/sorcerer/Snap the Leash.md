### 📜 Description
You remove the shackles of domestication from a creature's mind, so that it entirely forgets being broken or trained. Mounts refuse all riders, and other animals forget any tricks learned and obedience taught.

Memories are not affected, so creatures may remain drawn to those who have treated them kindly and aggressive toward those who have harmed them. The animal can be domesticated again, but the trainer must start from scratch.

This spell is only partly effective against animals with more than 2 Intelligence, animal companions, familiars, and paladin mounts. Although the spell removes any tricks they know, the bond between animal and master is otherwise unaffected.
