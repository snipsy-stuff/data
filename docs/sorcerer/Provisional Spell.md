### 📜 Description
You cast this spell as well as another spell of 4th level or lower to be "stored." When a specific spell you name (of any level) is cast upon the subject, the stored spell releases in a preset manner. The stored spell takes effect immediately after the target spell in the same round. 

A target and his gear may have only one provisional spell active at a time, meaning you cannot cast this spell on both a barbarian and the barbarian's axe. If the impetus spell does not affect the target because of a successful save or spell resistance, the provisional spell still triggers. If the stored spell cannot be cast as designated by the caster (due to range, line of sight, etc.), the spell has no effect and the provisional spell is lost.
