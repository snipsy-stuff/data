### 📜 Description
The target of this spell experiences a powerful need to travel and explore. On a failed save, the creature is compelled to leave the area (though it may hastily pack first), traveling for 8 hours in a random direction. The target creature may make periodic stops during its trek, and can detour or hide to avoid danger as normal. For the balance of the journey though, it must travel for 45 minutes of every hour with the intention of leaving its former location behind.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
