### 📜 Description
You transform ambient ley power into a powerful bolt of energy, dealing 1d6 hp ley energy damage per level (maximum 10d6) to each creature along its path. The bolt begins at your fingertips and can pass through any one object (e.g. walls, floors, ceilings, etc.) along its path without decreasing in intensity. However, when it reaches a second object, it hits that object and fizzles. Any creatures under cover (even full cover) from an object are affected normally by ley energy bolt as long as the bolt has not already passed through an object.
