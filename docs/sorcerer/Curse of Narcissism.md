### 📜 Description
The subject is consumed with self-love. The ramifications of his new outlook vary depending upon the circumstances. In combat situations, the affected creature does everything possible to avoid injury. Flight is his first choice, although he can make ranged attacks if he perceives that he can do so from a position of relative safety. If he is forced to engage to melee combat, he always fights defensively, suffering a -4 penalty to attack rolls but gaining a +2 dodge bonus to AC.

Under non-stressful situations, the creature incessantly brags about his attributes including his physical appearance, intelligence, valorous deeds, romantic conquests and any other subject that casts him in the most favorable light. His endless boasting and self-aggrandizement cause him to suffer a -4 penalty to ability and skill checks with Charisma as the key ability. If the narcissistic creature sees his reflection in a mirror or another suitable surface, he spends the next 1d6 rounds admiring his beauty to the exclusion of all external events except for those that could cause him potential harm, such as combat.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
