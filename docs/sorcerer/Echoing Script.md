### üìú Description
You create a piece of text that appears normal and harmless at first glance, but poses a serious danger to anyone reading it. In this case, "reading" the script means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. 

On a successful Will save, the reader of the echoing script is able to look away with only a slight sense of discomfort, but a failed save causes the reader to suffer a phantasmal assault that wreaks havoc on the mind; the victim is gripped with two forms of insanity known as echopraxia (mimicking movements) and echolalia (mimicking words). The creature always says and does what the creatures closest to it has said and done in the last round. For example, if the closest creature it can see attacked with its sword, the victim would act out attacking with a sword. But if the creature farthest away from it was the only one who spoke then it repeats that creature's words, if it can hear it. If the victim cannot see or hear anyone, it can act normally. 

Echoing script vanishes if even one creature reads it; but several different creatures can begin reading in the same round and all be affected. 

You can follow a secret page spell immediately by echoing script, so only creatures that discover the secret page are subject to the effects of this spell. 

Dispel magic and remove curse do not remove the echopraxia and echolalia. Greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.
