### 📜 Description
One of the greatest punishments that can be inflicted upon an arcane spellcaster or mystical creature is to strip her of her ability to perform magic. For a sorcerer, the loss of her natural powers can be a fate worse than death. As a result, this ritual is not undertaken lightly. It involves a lengthy incantation and the creation of a complex mystical seal around the victim, so she must be unconscious, restrained, or a willing participant in the ritual.

The target loses the ability to cast any form of arcane magic (spell or spell-like) or use any supernatural ability for as long as the spell remains in effect. 

You have the power to restore her abilities at any time; otherwise, she can only regain her mystical abilities as a result of a break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Remove curse only grants a second saving throw; if this second save is unsuccessful, the spell has no further effect.
