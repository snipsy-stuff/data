### 📜 Description
This spell affects a single manufactured object weighing no more than 1 lb. per level. If the object fails a Fortitude save, all manufactured pieces of the object revert to their raw state. Metal becomes ore, leather becomes animal hide, etc. Objects already in their raw form suffer no effects from reverse industry.
