### 📜 Description
The caster gains a brief glimpse into the future and sees where the strands of fate draw him. At any one time during the spell's duration, the caster may react  to an event before it happens. The instant someone declares an action the character wishes to prevent, or a die roll comes up in a way the player doesn't like, he may declare it as the event he foresaw, and may take a single standard action just before it happens. This works like a readied action, in that it may interrupt or prevent the action triggering it. He may make an attack, cast a spell, move out of the way, or simply shout a warning. Of course, the character must still make any applicable rolls to see if his preemptive action worked. Further, if the action does not work, any relevant rolls stand - they need not be rerolled. For instance, during combat, a giant scorpion stings the caster's ally, a rogue, poisoning him. The caster had kismet's whisper cast, and so declares he saw the sting coming and uses his extra action to disintegrate the scorpion before the attack lands. Should the scorpion makes its save against the spell, and the resulting damage does not kill it, it will sting the rogue anyway, as the dice already indicated its attack hit and the rogue failed his save. 

When the caster declares the use of this ability, the spell is ended and only one event may be foreseen per casting.
