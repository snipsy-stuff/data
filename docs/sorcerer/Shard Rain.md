### 📜 Description
You cause razor-sharp shards of adamantine, cold iron, or silver to fall on an area, tearing through flesh and armor alike, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures with damage reduction 5 or greater that is not overcome by magic, piercing, and/or the chosen material type damage are immune to this effect. The fragments of the shards remain scattered over the area of the spell's effect, but disappear after 1 round.
