### 📜 Description
This spell combines protection from elements with an unusual effect: whenever the caster is struck by a spell or supernatural ability that deals the selected energy damage, the spell triggers a 1st- to 3rd-level spell whose target and area of effect is up to the caster. Up to three spells, one 1st, one 2nd, and one 3rd, may be triggered; the spells and the order in which they're triggered is set at the time of the casting of energetic contingency. The triggered spell must be one that's been prepared by the caster, but triggering it does not expend the spell slot.
