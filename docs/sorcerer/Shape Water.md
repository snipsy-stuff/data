### 📜 Description
You can shape water into any hard object. The object is solid but fine details aren't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shapes that have moving parts simply don't work.

Aquatic spellcasters use this spell to construct items not easily fashioned underwater such as doors, walls, chests, bottles, cups, and coffins. The items are translucent and have a hard, glass-like consistency, with hardness 5 and 5 hp per inch of thickness.
