### 📜 Description
Lava jets forth like a small volcano. Though the lava loses some of its fiery heat, it still inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level, to a maximum of 15d6. In addition, targets who fail their Reflex saves get covered in a thin layer of rocky, stiff residue as the lava cools, gaining the Entangled condition. If the targets are standing on a solid surface, the lava anchors them, reducing their speed to zero. These Entagled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. A full round action can be spent chipping the rock away. Removing the rock requires a creature to drop its guard as it pulls the coating from the victim's body, thus provoking an attack of opportunity. A successful saving throw results in half damage and negates the Entangled condition.
