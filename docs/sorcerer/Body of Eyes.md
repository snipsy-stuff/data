### 📜 Description
Eye-shaped spots emerge all over your skin and clothing, granting you a +10 competence bonus on all Perception checks related to vision. While under the effects of this spell, you cannot be flanked. However, since you are peering out in all directions at once, you cannot avert or close your eyes to avoid gaze effects or any other effect that relies on a target having the sense of sight.
