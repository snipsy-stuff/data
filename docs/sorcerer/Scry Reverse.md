### 📜 Description
If you become aware that you are being scried and cast this spell, you immediately begin scrying the scrier as if you had successfully cast scrying to find the scrier. This spell functions even if you know nothing about the scrier, and you can continue to scry him even if he ends his own scry. This reversal does not end the original scry.
