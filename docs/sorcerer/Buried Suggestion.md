### 📜 Description
As suggestionsuggestion, except the target need not understand the caster. The caster telepathically implants the suggestion into the subject.

The suggestion planted must not take place immediately. When it occurs it must be based on an event or an amount of time going by. At least three days must pass before the suggestion compels the subject. During the period while the suggestion is buried, neither divination spells nor Sense Motive will reveal that the subject is under the effect of an enchantment. Attempts to remove the suggestion during this period, such as with dispel magic or break enchantment, add a +10 bonus to the DC. The subject does not attempt his saving throw until the triggering event occurs.
