### üìú Description
This devious and complicated spell is intended to make real objects appear to be illusions. Anyone interacting with he affected object should make a Will save, as per the standard rules for disbelieving illusions. A successful Will save indicates that the PC senses the subtle magic of illusion covering the object, at which point he is likely to assume that the object is actually a spell such as programmed image. He pays the price for this assumption if the object is a creature intent on attacking him! In other words, the PC does indeed detect a real illusion, but this illusion is merely a "layer" upon a very real object. Illusory illusion tricks the character into assuming a certain object is an illusion. 

Conversely, a failed Will save means that the PC wasn't intuitive enough to detect the faint presence of the illusion magic, so he behaves as if the object were real - which it truly is. The target of the spell is actually those seeing the figment. While the illusory illusion is cast around an object or creature, that object or creature is not truly the recipient of the spell.
