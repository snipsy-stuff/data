### 📜 Description
You draw on ancient lore to allow yourself one chance to possibly avoid death, even when it otherwise would be inevitable. You can only cast this spell if you would die; instead of dying, you send your soul for safekeeping into the opal gemstone in a pocket dimension. 

Your body remains; to all means of physical and magical examination, you appear dead (your soul can still be trapped, or questioned). 

The soul remains in the receptacle until 100 days pass or you discharge the spell; when you do so, the opal is consumed, and you appear on the plane at that very spot you should have died, at 0 hit points, with two negative levels, regardless of what condition your body was in after your soul was safeguarded. Other non-life threatening spells or effects remain (ability damage and drain above 0, permanent spell effects, negative levels 1 above your HD, etc.) For example, if a mage falls in battle and triggers this spell and his foes disintegrated his body and spread the ash to the four corners of the earth, the body is reconstituted when the soul returns, though its equipment may no longer be there.
