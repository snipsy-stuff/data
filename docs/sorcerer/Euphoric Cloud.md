### 📜 Description
You create a bank of fog similar to that created by fog cloud except its vapors are intoxicating. Living creatures in the cloud become fascinated. This condition lasts as long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Any creature that succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.
