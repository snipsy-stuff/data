### 📜 Description
You create a net of shining starstuff, thrumming with celestial energies and shot through with a luminescent trail of stars. This net provides enough light to increase illumination in the area by one step.

In addition, anyone in the spell's area must make a Reflex save. Success means the creature is burned for 1 hp positive energy damage per level but not prevented from moving. Failure means the creature is burned for 3 hp positive energy damage per level and must make a Will save in each following round or become fascinated and take another 3 hp positive energy damage per level.

If a Will save succeeds, the creature escapes the shining net of comets, suffers no further damage, and can move normally that round. Undead suffer take double damage from a net of comets. If at least 5 ft. of the net are between you and an opponent, it provides concealment. If you have at least 20 ft. of net between you, it provides cover.
