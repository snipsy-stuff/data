### 📜 Description
The target stops aging. She continues to experience age effects, but has no maximum age. When casting the spell, make a caster level check (DC 30). If you succeed, the target looks youthful and remains that way. If unsuccessful, she continues to look older and older as time passes, becoming a dreadful, shriveled husk. This spell can only be cast once on any living creature.
