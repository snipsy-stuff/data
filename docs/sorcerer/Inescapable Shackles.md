### 📜 Description
This spell causes a set of shackles made of force to come into being and affix themselves to the target creature, immobilizing it, and anchoring it to its current location; no force can move the shackles from this location. The creature is also rendered helpless. Creatures who fail their save receive no chance to use Escape Artist to slip their bonds, and have no chance of bursting their bonds. Any creature bound within them is affected as if a dimensional anchor spell were cast upon it (no save). An inescapable shackles is immune to dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction can still dispel it. An inescapable shackles can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys it. It can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but the bonds formed by inescapable shackles have hardness 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or rod of cancellation instantly destroys the shackles. 

Creatures that make their saving throw are instead entangled for 1 round. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell.
