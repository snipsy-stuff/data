### 📜 Description
This deadly spell summons a swarm of poisonous snakes. The swarm is under your mental command as long as you concentrate, and it deals 1d6 hp damage plus 1d6 hp poison for every four levels you have (see the venomous snake swarm in the Pathfinder Bestiary). Otherwise, treat this as a standard summon swarm spell, and use the rules for the swarm subtype in the Pathfinder Bestiary.
