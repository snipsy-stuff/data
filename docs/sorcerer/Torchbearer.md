### üìú Description
You conjure a Medium-sized, humanoid creature. The torchbearer appears with a newly-lit torch, which it carries for you or the one person for whom you specifically created the torchbearer. A torchbearer appears to be a short, burly human dressed in livery of whatever color you specify. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it. 

The torchbearer has an AC of 11 (+0 size, +1 Dex) and 4 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the torchbearer disappears, as does the torch it was carrying. A torchbearer has a base speed of 20 feet, and a Strength score of 11 (for purposes of encumbrance). It does not fight. 

The torchbearer's torch sheds light as an ordinary torch, and remains with the torchbearer; it cannot be given to anyone else. The light produced by the torch increases according to caster level. A torchbearer's abilities include those of torchbearers of lower caster levels.
