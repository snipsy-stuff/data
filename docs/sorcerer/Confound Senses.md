### 📜 Description
This spell befuddles the minds of the targets. Those that fail their Will saves have their speed reduced to half, as they find moving difficult. In addition, the targets take a -4 penalty on ranged attack rolls.

Affected creatures find it impossible to keep track of their location as well. They automatically fail any Survival skill checks to avoid getting lost and cannot remember where they have recently been in relation to where they are now. Whenever the affected creatures must choose between one or more paths, they choose at random and do not remember which directioin they chose. At the end of the spell duration, they are lost.
