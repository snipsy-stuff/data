### 📜 Description
You summon Huge water elementals from a significant body of open water, such as a pond, lake, sea or ocean. You summon one Huge water elemental for every 5 levels you possess. You may mentally command them each round as a swift action to attack foes, tear down structures, and so on.

}If they are within the spell's range from the water from which they were summoned, the elementals can make themselves into a vortex on land and do not suffer any penalties.

Water elementals that move beyond the spell's range from the water's edge lose these bonuses, and you must succeed in a DC 25 Spellcraft check each round or that elemental is dispelled.
