### 📜 Description
With a single utterance, you can shoot a ray of force at a selected target. To hit you must make a ranged touch attack. If it is successful, you deal 1d6 points of force damage to the target per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). 

You can cast this spell and interrupt another's actions (such as casting a spell). Casting immediate force counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.
