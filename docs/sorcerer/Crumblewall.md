### 📜 Description
This arcane siege spell is similar to earthquake, but it topples large structures made of masonry or hewn stone, including castles, fortifications, temples, and so on. The target structure or structure portion may be of any height, but it cannot be more than 80 feet in length or width.

When cast, this spell instantaneously opens a running fissure in a straight line from you to the target structure. The fissure remains about 5 ft. in width and 20 ft. in depth until it reaches the target, at which it becomes a gaping chasm.

Any creature in the straight line between you and the target structure must make a Reflex save to avoid falling into the fissure. Creatures that fall into the fissure take 2d6 hp damage. The target structure takes damage equal to 2d4 times 100. Because this damage is magically keyed to affect structures, this damage is not halved as with object damage and bypasses any of the structure's hardness. If the damage exceeds the hp of the masonry or stone structure, then the structure collapses.

Anyone standing in or on the collapsing structure or within a distance equal to the height of the structure takes 8d6 hp damage with a DC 15 Reflex save for half damage. Creatures failing the saving throw are pinned beneath rubble, as per the earthquake spell.

If this spell would affect a portion of a structure, only the creatures inside that portion or within a distance of its height take damage when that portion falls.
