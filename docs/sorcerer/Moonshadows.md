### üìú Description
With this spell, you turn the target creatures' shadows into quasi-real shadow monsters that harass and attack the target. A moonshadow created by this spell remains attached to the target creature just as a normal shadow does. The moonshadow takes up no space, remaining in the same space as the creature to which it is attached and moving when that creature does. 

Every turn the spell lasts (starting the round you cast it), each moonshadow attacks the creature to which it is attached. If the creature is standing, the moonshadow attempts to trip it (CMB equal to the CMB of the victim). If the trip attempt succeeds, the target creature falls prone and is consider grappled by its attached moonshadow. If the trip attempt fails, the target creature remains standing but is entangled (DC equal to spell's DC). If the creature is prone, the moonshadow makes a Combat Maneuver check, dealing 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage if it succeeds. A prone, grappled creature can break the moonshadow's hold by making a successful Combat Maneuver check or Escape Artist check opposed by the CMB of the spell, and if successful, can use a move action to stand (though the moonshadow remains attached and the creature remains entangled). 

A moonshadow fights exactly as the creature to which it is attached. It has 5 hit points per caster level (maximum 75), It is immune to nonlethal damage, and most magical effects that don't cause damage don't affect it (though it is subject to dispel magic and disjunction). A moonshadow never provokes an attack of opportunity, nor does it threaten an area. 

If a target creature makes a successful Will save, it disbelieves the quasi-real moonshadows and has a 50% chance of not being entangled (check once when the successful save is made). All combat maneuver attempts a moonshadow makes against a disbeliever have a 50% chance of automatic failure, and deal only half damage. 

This spell is not effective when the target creatures are casting no significant shadows, including in areas of darkness (magical or otherwise) or in an area subject to a daylight spell or the light of the midday sun. Once you successfully cast the spell, though, the moonshadows remain despite any changes in lighting.
