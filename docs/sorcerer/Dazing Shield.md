### 📜 Description
A flaring aura of pale white energy surrounds you. Any creature making contact with this aura by means of a melee attack (though only if the attack comes from a target in your threatened area) must make a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. If the creature fails its save, the melee attack that prompted the Will save is negated. The aura can also ward off a spell attack or spell-like effect that specifically targets you. If the attacker fails his Will save, his spell is wasted and he is dazed. In addition, if the dazing shield successfully wards off a spell, it instantly ends as well.
