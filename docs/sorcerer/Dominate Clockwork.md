### 📜 Description
This spell brings a clockwork device instantly under your control. A clockwork device affected by this spell will only respond to your commands and activations and no one else's, not even its creator's.

You can command and activate it with your voice only. A construct or vehicle dominated in this way does not attack you and obeys all your commands, even if the command is to attack the original owner. A construct with a bound soul is still dominated, and the spirit within loses control of its clockwork body unless you allow it any control.
