### 📜 Description
You learn the names of all the creature's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, including but not limited to Special Defenses, Special Attacks, and Special Qualities. You can cast this spell on a piece of the creature or the creature's scat. You can cast the spell on decayed, desiccated or fresh parts of a creature. Once you cast the spell you gain the knowledge (the names), but you do not learn the details of what those abilities do.
