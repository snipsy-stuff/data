### üìú Description
You imbed within the target's mind a mental duplicate of your thought patterns. There are three purposes of psychic clone: to unlock and retrieve knowledge stored somewhere in the subject's mind, to protect the subject's life, and to prevent the subject from harming or allowing harm to come to the caster.

While under the effects of mind blank, protection from evil or a similar spell, the subject can ignore the compulsion, but such a ward does not prevent establishing psychic clone, nor dispel it.

The spell serves its purposes in the following manner:

‚Ä¢ The psychic clone can cause the subject to enter a coma for 30 minutes, making the subject seem dead, though a successful Perception or Heal check (DC 15 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier) reveals that the victim is still alive.

‚Ä¢ The psychic clone can control the subject's memory and nervous system allowing it to create any phantasmal spell effect it wishes though only the subject perceives the illusion (disbelief DC equal to DC of this spell) and can also modify memory (same DC) on the subject.

‚Ä¢ Once per day it can dominate the subject for 1 hour as dominate monster (DC equal to DC of this spell).

‚Ä¢ The psychic clone can protect its subject as if it is a mind blank spell and as a misdirection spell if it so wishes.

‚Ä¢ The psychic clone has a mental link to the caster that allows the caster to track the subject as if the caster were using discern location.

‚Ä¢ The psychic clone contains much of the caster's knowledge and intellect. This includes any of the caster's skill ranks and memories at the time of the casting but he will not have access to any of the caster's spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural, extraordinary or other class abilities. It can choose to communicate its knowledge and information if it believes it will serve its goals. It also has perfect recollection of everything the PC experiences (except when suppressed, see below).

A successful Will save against the spell or any of its effects suppresses all the effects of the psychic clone for 24 hours.
