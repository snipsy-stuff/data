### üìú Description
By touching a door or gate with your focus, you turn it into a one-way portal to another such door within the spell's range. This spell works with any crafted door, doorway, archway, or other artificial opening. It will not work with natural or accidental openings such as cave entrances or cracks in walls. You must be aware of your destination's location or have line of sight to it.

On completing the spell, the touched door opens, revealing a shimmering image of the location beyond the destination door. You may step through the door, emerging instantly out of the destination door. Alternatively, you may allow one other willing creature to pass through the portal instead. Anything you carry moves through the door with you, including other creatures, willing or unwilling.

For purposes of the spell, any locks, bars, or magical effects such as arcane lock are ineffectual for the spell's duration. You may only travel to a side of the door you can see or have physically been to in the past (divinations such as clairvoyance count as seeing). Once you or a willing creature passes through, both doors shut, ending the spell. If you or another creature do not move through the portal within 1 round, the spell ends.
