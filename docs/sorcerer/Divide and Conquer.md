### 📜 Description
This spell causes you to divide into 300 tiny duplicates of yourself. Each duplicate resembles you exactly, and has tiny duplicates of all your equipment. Your single mind acts as a hive mind for all the tiny bodies, and causes them to act more or less in tandem. Taken collectively, this form made from hundreds of tiny versions of you retains most of your basic statistics, including hit points, abilities, and armor class. In this form you gain the traits of a swarm possessing a hive mind (see Pathfinder Bestiary). The damage from your swarm attack equals the damage you would deal with a single successful hit of the weapon you currently wield, and you distract creatures in your area as normal. 

Instead of using your swarm attack, you may take nearly any other action you would be able to (except a standard attack), including casting a spell, or activating a magical device. In these cases your tiny duplicates all cast the same spell or activate the same magic item, but the effect is the same as though you were not affected by divide and conquer. In these cases you do not deal damage with your swarm attack or distract creatures occupying your squares.
