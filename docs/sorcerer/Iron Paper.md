### 📜 Description
You cause paper, parchment, or similar materials to become as strong and resistant to heat and stress as steel, while retaining most of their other traits, including weight. Such paper can either be shaped before using the spell with a Craft (origami) check, or can be shaped afterwards with smith equipment and the appropriate Craft skills. 

Furthermore, if you choose to target only half as much paper as could otherwise be affected, armor, shields, or weapons you create gain an enhancement bonus equal to one-fourth your caster level (maximum +5).
