### 📜 Description
Shadow sentry, greater creates either a shadowy or three-eyed humanoid (AC 15) under your command. The sentry may be commanded to "guard," where it shouts an alarm if it notices anyone approach within 30 ft (using the caster's Perception score +3), "patrol," where it follows a route first walked by the caster and calls an alarm if it notices anyone approach within 30 feet, and "attack," where it attacks with its shadowy greatsword (1d12 + 1 point / 3 levels). The sentry has a BAB equal to the caster's level and adds the caster's associated stat bonus. (A 5th level sorcerer with a Charisma of 16 creates a sentry has a BAB of +5, and an attack of +8. It inflicts 1d12+2 damage.) The sentry may provide an ally a flanking bonus, but does not benefit from one. The sentry is discharged after being successfully struck for 25 hp of damage. It has saves equal to the caster's.
