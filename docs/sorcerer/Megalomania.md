### 📜 Description
You force creatures to believe that their skills are so much better than they really are that their overconfidence causes them to act rashly and without forethought. The targets begin to make wild swings, confident in their ability to overwhelm an opponent. Spell casters confidently step into battle believing they can't be struck before completing a spell. Creatures failing their Will saves gain a -4 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, and will not retreat; they also believe they are much tougher than they actually are (treat the creatures as believing they have extra hit points equal to your caster level (maximum of 20) even though they do not possess them).
