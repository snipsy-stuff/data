### 📜 Description
You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Charisma; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell do not lose any bonus spells for the decreased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do decrease.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, eagle's splendor, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.

Eagle's curse counters eagle's splendor.
