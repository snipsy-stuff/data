### 📜 Description
A small black ball of compressed negative energy streaks from your hand to a range and height you designate. When it reaches its target, it blossoms into a spread of soul-devouring energy, causing all creatures in the area to gain 1d3 negative levels.

Unstoppable bleakness attempts to dispel (as described in greater dispel magic) any death ward spell or magic item that grants immunity to negative levels. If the dispel check succeeds, the death ward is dispelled before the negative levels take effect (magic items are suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds). 

Unstoppable bleakness cannot target any spot through a space smaller than an open window. If the black ball impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, it detonates prematurely. Assuming that creatures within the area survive the negative levels, they regain lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 20 hours). Usually negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim's levels, but the negative levels from unstoppable bleakness do not last long enough to do so. 

Undead creatures in the area of an unstoppable bleakness gain 1d4 x 5 temporary hit points. These hit points fade after 1 hour.
