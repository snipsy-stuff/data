### 📜 Description
Upon casting this spell, your hand pulses with a soft blue light. You may touch a target creature to borrow the ranks it has in any one skill. On your next action, you can make a single skill check using the subject's ranks, but modified by your own key ability. If a skill check requires more than 1 round to make, you may not use this spell to borrow that skill.
