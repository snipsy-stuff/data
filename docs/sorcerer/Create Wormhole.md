### 📜 Description
You create a temporary wormhole between two points in space within range and your line of sight. Each side of the wormhole takes up a 5-ft. square space, and it must be placed on a spot of stable ground. If a creature or object enters that space, it is instantly transported to the other space. If it does not move out of the other space as part of its movement, it is automatically shunted to an unoccupied square adjacent to that space as part of this teleportation.

If there is no unoccupied space on the other end of the wormhole, creatures and objects cannot pass through it. Effectively, its passage is cut off.
