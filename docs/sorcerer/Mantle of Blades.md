### 📜 Description
Mantle of blades creates six copies of the focus weapon that hover around you and deflect incoming attacks. Each weapon provides a +1 shield bonus (this bonus stacks with itself up to a +6 shield bonus; it does not stack with other shield bonuses).

As a standard action, you can launch one of the weapons at an enemy within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft./level) as a ranged touch attack. On a successful attack, each weapon deals 4d6 hp force damage.

Once a weapon is launched, it does not return, and the shield bonus granted by this spell is reduced.
