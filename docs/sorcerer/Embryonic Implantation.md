### üìú Description
Tapping into the genetic material of an alien creature, you impregnate a creature you touched with an aberrant abomination that grows slowly to maturity inside the target‚Äôs body. If the target saves, the embryo fails to implant and the spell has no effect. If the save fails, you may stipulate the time span of the embryo‚Äôs maturation, which may be 2d6 hours, 2d6 days, 2d6 months, or 2d6 years. During this time, the alien seed exists as a parasite bonded to the target‚Äôs vitals. Conjuration (healing) effects treat the embryo as part of the target‚Äôs body and do not harm the embryo. However, break enchantment can remove it with a successful caster level check. Poison that deals Constitution damage can also kill the embryo, acting like break enchantment but rolling 1d20 and adding the number of points of Constitution damage or drain dealt to the host in place of a caster level check. Make a single check when the embryo matures; any Constitution damage or drain that has been healed does not apply to this check. The embryo also dies if the host does, even if the host is later returned to life.

The implanted embryo is difficult to detect, as most divinations treat it as part of the host. However, detect chaos, detect aberration, and locate creature can detect the presence of the embryo with a successful caster level check against a DC of 20 plus your caster level, as can a Heal check against the same DC.

The maturing embryo saps at the vitality and sanity of the target. Whichever time increment you have selected (hours, days, months, or years), each time that increment passes the target takes 1 point of Wisdom drain. Once Wisdom drain occurs, the target becomes mentally unstable and takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects and must always attempt a saving throw to resist normally harmless healing effects.

When the maturation period described above ends, the target becomes violently ill, becoming fatigued and sickened. A DC 30 Perception check (or DC 20 Heal check, if the host is closely examined) reveals something writhing and stretching within the host‚Äôs body. Every round thereafter, the target takes 1 point of Constitution drain as the implanted embryo begins eating its way out of its host and must make a new Fortitude save against the spell‚Äôs DC. Each time the save is failed, he gains one of the following conditions (determine randomly): ‚Ä¢ 01-25 confused ‚Ä¢ 26-50 exhausted ‚Ä¢ 51-75 nauseated ‚Ä¢ 76-00 panicked Whenever the target reaches 0 Constitution, or on the third failed save in any case, the target dies at the end of its turn and the embryonic creature bursts forth from its body. The type of embryonic creature that can be implanted depends on your caster level.

Caster level      Implanted creature
up to 14th         Embryonic aboleth
15th-17th          Embryonic intellect devourer or neh-thalggu
18th or greater   Embryonic shoggoth

Once mature, the embryonic creature is an independent being and has no allegiance to the caster. It devours the remains of its original host and seeks out further prey to help it grow into its full-sized adult form.
